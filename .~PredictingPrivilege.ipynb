      "0\tso the first thing that we're going to do is i'm going to tell you a little bit about myself and the research that i'm working on, and then i'll give you a chance to ask any questions that you may have, and then we can get started with our interview. does that sound good with you? yeah, that is fine with me. ok, great. so my name is , and i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of the research team... wait, i didn't... i'm sorry? i didn't quite get your...you said your name is? . . c-l... a-r-a. ok, that is fine. yes. and i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience. in the next 30 minutes, i will ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and how you feel about coursera in general. you can tell me as much or as little as you would like. if you prefer not to answer some of the questions, then that is perfectly fine. your privacy is important to me, so after this interview is over, your name and email address will be removed from my notes. that way, nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity. your email address will be stored separately. that is fine. your email address will be stored separately and be used to email you your amazon gift card. after all the data has been collected and all the interview participants have been paid, all of the identifying information will be destroyed. to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i would like to audio record our conversation. after my notes and the audio recording are transcribed, i will delete the recording.your participation is completely voluntary, and at any point, you may choose to stop the interview. your interview will not affect your class performance in any way, and the instructor, dr. canelas, will not know whether or not you participated in this research. if you have questions about this research, please ask me at any point, and if you have questions at a later time, please contact dukecoursera gmail.com. finally, i would just like to confirm that you are 18 years or older. is that true? yes, definitely. yeah. ok, good. do you have any questions for me at this point? no. so far, i'm fine. please can you just hold on? there is a call coming in for me. just one minute. yeah.[background conversation] all right, , you can continue. the first question i have for you is just for you to tell me about yourself, if you are working, what kind of work you do, your academic background, anything that you find is important? i'm a lecturer at a university. i have qualifications in chemistry at masters' level. i'm teaching undergraduate pharmacy and medical student's chemistry that's relevant for their courses. before joining the university, i spent about 18 years teaching science at high school. i have extensive knowledge of chemistry and teaching of the subject. i think that is basic information about me. what made you decide to take this course? like i said, teaching undergraduate students chemistry, some of them are coming from very poor background, very weak knowledge of chemistry. learning this, putting myself in the position of a student and learning these through coursera also improves the way i interact with my student, especially those that are coming from very poor background. have you taken coursera courses before this course? yes, i did one on the use of chromatography, which i found quite useful. in fact, that was why i felt encouraged to take this one that i'm currently running. how did you hear about coursera? i got information from my dean, who is actually a british citizen. he found it useful because it gives him the opportunity to revise his chemistry. that was when he referred us to that site. when i looked it up, i found it quite useful as well. do you think that if this material was not available on coursera, would you look for a different way to learn this material? of course. to me, it's not really learning anything new as such, but to see how the materials are organized, to make a more powerful impact on the student. like i said, me especially, most of the information is not new to me. but the way they organize the material makes them, probably we're not there. i would again like to see how this material could be organized [inaudible 06:36] on the students. how many hours do you think that you, per week, spend on this course? like i said, i'm not really new to it. even if i spend about two hours as such, it refreshes my mind very well that it makes me deliver my lectures better, to interact with the student at a better rate, roughly about two hours a week, mostly weekends. what part of the course do you participate in? there is lot of parts to it. there is the video lectures, the quizzes, the problem sets, the discussion forums, what parts do you take part in? just hold on a little bit, .[background conversation] yeah, we can continue. the next question i had for you is \"what parts of the course do you participate in?\" i watch the videos, the materials, the quizzes. i have not been able to start with the quiz, but i intend to at least participate in some of the quizzes before the end of the course. the videos and the presentations are quite important, i watch those ones regularly. are you interested in getting the certificate at the end, the statement of accomplishment? definitely, yes. like the one i did on chromatography, i didn't finish, so i didn't get that certificate, but this one, i hope to complete it to at least have some recognition for my effort. have you interacted with any of the other students in the class? no, not yet. have you been on the discussion forums before? no. it's actually the first time i'm there. like i said, i'm learning it to improve the deliverance of the topic so i've not been very active with other students. how is chemistry taught differently in the united states at duke university versus how it's taught where you? where i am, like i said, because of the different background of students coming from diverse cultural groups, diverse levels of knowledge, so most of it is time. we have to go into didactic teaching really to explain concepts from scratch. because of lack of resources, we don't really go into investigative method of teaching because of cost and time constraint.most of the time it's didactic teaching, explaining everything concept every day and expect them to read the few materials that are available to them to have a good understanding of the subject matter. do you think that's different from how chemistry is taught through the coursera course? yeah, because i see there that there are some aspects of investigation that students are encouraged to do. for instance, to do a little bit of investigation and see how things work. for instance, the one that i participated in was using simple chocolate to find out how we can use [inaudible 12:33] to separate it. this also makes it possible for my, what i teach, to refer to this simple investigation that a student can participate in without necessarily going to the lab.i see that component, quite interesting, and a powerful way to get information through to the students. let's see. how do you think that this course, learning chemistry through this, compares to how you learned chemistry when you first learned it? like i said, it's quite different coming from a poor resources setting. we only have access to laboratories that are probably not well-equipped and we're not that fortunate to be aware that one can actually do some of these things outside the laboratory. the way coursera is presenting the lectures and giving relevant information of things that can be done outside the lab really makes it very different from the way we were taught.we thought those days that you could only do chemistry having a well-equipped laboratory outside the environment. from the coursera perspective, we see that some of the investigation we need to do can be done outside a lab. that aspect really makes it quite impressive and makes chemistry quite relevant in everyday life. with that, it's quite powerful to mention it to understand that what they are being taught is not something that is so abstract.rather, it's something that has impact in their day-to-day life, something that's relevant in their everyday life. that makes it quite interesting and very different from the way we were taught. do you any of your students take coursera courses? not yet. what we just decided this academic year, by next semester what i intend to do, because i downloaded some of the courses i took on chromatography, that is when i will be teaching that topic. my intention is to let them have access to those materials and, naturally, encourage them to take some other courses because it makes it a lot easier for us to understand ourselves in the class if they have exposure.by the second semester, hopefully right about june, i'm going to really encourage them to get ready for these courses that we're at that time. do you think that where you are is online learning a common thing or is it not very common? it is coming a bit commonplace. with the availability to internet access, the internet, and skype, lots of students are becoming interested. for instance, sometimes i would teach a subject and refer them to youtube, to google to get more information, more than what the lecture would give. it's gradually picking up, yeah.one of my colleagues did his diploma in management and his course was 100 percent online. that has encouraged some of us to step in that direction to improve our standing. how do you think the quality of online courses compares to the quality of in-classroom courses? i think the quality is quite high because, looking at the chemistry course i'm currently doing, it has all the components that we have in our school. there was even a time when i was teaching [inaudible 16:54] i looked up some materials of old lecture that were presented. that's actually helped me to compile my own study guide for my students. i think the quality is quite high. it's quite high comparable to what you have in former schools. how do you feel about courses that are styled like coursera courses, courses with thousands of students that learn together online? how do you feel about those? sorry, i didn't get your question. how do you feel about online courses that are taught in this style of coursera? to me, i think it's a privilege to have access to such courses because if you look at some of the people that are full employment maybe not being able to get sponsorship to go for four time studies. the few hours we have at our disposal, we can put them to use productively through this kind of online studies.especially, the work we're now trying to do is to see if the government can recognize such online course because, like i said, this is just picking up. with time we hope the government will give recognition to such knowledge acquired online.once we're at that stage i think it becomes quite indispensable, especially for people that are doing full-time work. they will be able to contribute to, and build themselves a lifelong learning, to continually improve themselves in what they do. i think it's quite important. what do you think are some difficulties to online learning? one of the major challenges we have is in some of these [inaudible 19:06] , sometimes internet is a problem. sometimes we don't have connectivity. sometimes you try to log-on to websites, the library, you have to pay some fees. if you don't pay that you don't have access to this library.i think a major problem is the unstable network availability. sometimes you don't have network. in fact, i could have taken this call at my place but the service there is quite weak. we might not be able to communicate, that's why i'm still in my office now, at the university, where the internet is bit stronger. this is why we are able to discuss now.in some settings, in some locations in the city where i'm staying the internet provision is quite weak, which makes it quite difficult to connect with an online study. yeah, i think, for now, that is a major problem and access to resources online. for which people have to register with a credit card. those are not very popular here at the moment. how likely do you think you are to continue taking coursera courses? like i said, at the university we have a steady and strong internet provision. if there is a breakdown we have a team of it technicians that quickly come to our rescue to fix this thing. in my current situation i think i'm well placed to undertake any course online.i have an office computer. i have my private laptop, which makes it quite easy for me, too.as we are talking now, my office computer doesn't have a webcam, so i'm using my private laptop to communicate with you now. normally we can get some of this from the university, so in my present situation i think i'm well placed to do courses online. what kind of course do you think you will take? are you more likely to take courses in your area of study, in chemistry, or are you also interested in taking courses that are completely out of your area of study? i am actually at the moment searching for online courses that i can do in my area of specialization, for research. i'm a chemist. i'm trying to register online to do a phd. if i see a reputable online....[] hello? hello.. ok, yeah. can you pick up where you left off, about you trying to get a phd online? yes, i was saying that. you asked a question about if i'm prepared to take further online courses in my area of specialization or general areas. i said, \"yes.\" i am currently searching for a reputable online institution where i can enroll to study a phd program in chemistry.of course, i will also be interested to do courses in other areas, especially management, curriculum development, and how to maybe organize yourself properly. those are the minor courses online.yes, i'm willing to take such courses. but the primary one i want to pursue at the moment is to register for a full phd program online because, as a family person, i really don't want to travel out of the country to go and do three years of study again. if i have an opportunity to do it online i will gladly take that opportunity. those are all the questions that i had specifically for you. do you have anything else that you would like to add to our conversation? yes, i want to find out...many times i scroll through courses offered by coursera. i'm just wondering if they are looking at the possibility of improving or including in their courses things like if one can upgrade.like if one does chemistry, if they can do advanced chemistry studies with coursera. i just want to find out if they have plans in the near future to include such things in the program. i work more with duke university than i work with coursera. i'm not quite sure about the upcoming courses on coursera. i know that, just in my conversations that i've had with other coursera students, there is an advanced chemistry course that is currently being offered. i'm not sure what university it's offered by, but you could search for that and see if that's available to you? let's talk about duke university. do they have a phd program in medicinal chemistry? will you know? yeah, there is a phd program but it is not available online. it would only be at the school. at the school, residential. ok, all right. if you do come up with any other questions or comments at a later point in time you can always email me at dukecoursera gmail.com and i will get back to you. your amazon gift card should be in your email later today, in a few hours. but if for whatever reason it's not, again, please feel free to send me an email and i will get that figured out for you. ok, thank you very much. thank you for your time. my pleasure. bye. have a good rest of the day. ok, thank you very much. goodbye, have a nice evening. bye...\tC1\tMale\tGraduate\t20000-34999\t45-54\tNamibia\tAfrica\tChem\n",
      "1\tcan you hear me all right now? oh, yeah. you've always sounded fine, and the problem is getting it to pick up on me talking. oh, ok. yeah, i can hear you as well, so that's great. so i guess the first thing we're going to do in our interview is i'm just going to tell you a little bit about myself and the research that i'm working on, and then i'll give you a chance to ask any questions that you might have, and then we can get started. does that sound good with you? yeah, great. great. so my name is , and i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of the research team for the introduction to chemistry course, and i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience. in the next 30 minutes or so, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and how you feel about coursera in general.you can tell me as much or as little as you'd like, and if you don't want to answer any of the questions, then that's totally fine. your privacy of course is important to me, so after this interview is over, i will remove your name and email address from my notes. that way, nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity.your email address will be stored separate from my notes and be used to email you your amazon gift card. as soon as all the data has been collected and all the interview participants have been paid, all of the information will also be destroyed.to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i would like to audio record our conversation. after my notes and audio recording from our conversation are transcribed, i will delete that recording as well.you participation, of course, is completely voluntary. and at any point, you may choose to stop the interview. your interview will not affect your class performance in any way and the instructor dr. darrien conolos will not know whether or not you participated in this research.if you have questions about this research, please ask me at any point. and if you have questions at a later time, feel free to email dukecoursera gmail.com. finally, i would just like to confirm that you are 18 years or older. is that correct? oh, yeah. i'm 22 actually. ok. perfect. then we can get started. let's see. the first question i have for you is pretty general. if you could you just tell me about yourself - if you're still in school, if you're working a job, what kind of work you do, just anything you find relevant to this interview. ok. i was in school. two years ago was the last semester i was in. i did not graduate. i actually had to leave because i lost a decent part of my financial aid. i did a lot of social stuff. i let that get in the way a whole lot. i knew it even then that that was exactly was wrong.i don't think i'm going back to that particular school. i was studying at nku. i almost went to university of louisville instead. and i want to move to louisville eventually. so if i go back to a four-year school, that's most likely where i'll be.i changed my major a lot when i was in school. i started off undeclared. i thought i would go into pharmacy. and i'm still interested in science. but i don't think i'm really going to do pharmacy. i'm actually in the intro to pharmacy class on coursera. and i like it, but it's not really what i thought it was going to be.the last majors had declared when i left were biology and spanish. and i think i'm still going to stick with those two. and i don't know what i'm actually going to do with them. but i know i want to study them. [audio breaks] two jobs in the meantime - none of them really have anything to do with biology or spanish, though i speak some spanish at them.that's why my availability was so weird actually - the schedules for both of them changes on a weekly basis. ok. what are the two jobs that you are working at currently, if you don't mind my asking? oh, i don't mind. i work in a restaurant for one of them. i'm a hostess. i do all the takeout orders. eventually, i'm going to be cross-trained to serving and doing expo in the kitchen too. eventually, i'm kind of going to know how to do everything. and are you familiar with newport aquarium by chance? i am not. all right. well i live in newport, kentucky. and we have an aquarium here. for people that are into marine science, it's pretty well-known because we have as shark ray that recently had pups. it's actually the first time a shark ray in captivity has successfully been bred.and i don't work with the animals there. i do photography there. one of the things i'm looking into is possibly working there after i'm done with school - if i don't move to louisville - because they do have biologist all the time that do all the animal care. they do lab work. right. for now though, it's just pictures. ok. cool. so, let's see. what would say that your background is in science and math? would you say that you have a strong background in science and math, or a weak background in science and math? for math, i would say it's moderate. and i might be underestimating myself there, to be honest, because i seem to get better test scores and everything in it than i usually expect. i actually started off with an extremely weak background in science. i had that one high school teacher that changed my entire opinion on it and everything. and since then, i think i've been doing pretty well. how many chemistry courses have you taken before this course? if any. just the one in high school that was required and into to chemistry for college, which didn't actually go very well - very, very fast-paced professor. i needed someone who was a little slower.this class seems to be going better for me. the professor is very good about going at a good pace in the lecture videos. and i really do appreciate that. right. so what made you decide to enroll in this course? actually, the fact that i didn't do very well in my university into to chemistry. after i had to leave school, i ended up buying a couple books to self-teach myself. and one of them is for introduction to chemistry, because a lot of the math concepts in there are where i started to get lost. and eventually i would get them, but by then, they'd move on to something else... right. ...so i kept falling behind. and i found out about coursera through someone i know who's about to graduate, because she wanted to take classes on there. and i saw that introduction to chemistry was on there. and i thought, \"hey, why not?\" right. just reinforce what my own book is teaching me. so what is the motivation for learning chemistry period, i guess, even apart from this course? my motivation for learning chemistry originally was that i thought i was going to go into pharmacy. medical science was always something i was especially interested in. but i know that i might not do as well handling patients directly as i would doing other things for them, such as working with the medicine. ok. and i know that is a very chemistry heavy career. and even if i don't do pharmacy after all, i know that i need a good chemistry background for the biology degree. so, i guess, ultimately you're hoping that it will apply to you in your work setting in some way. is that correct? that's absolutely correct. yes. ok. sorry, i'm typing and talking. let's see. if this course was not available to you through coursera, would you seek out another way to learn this material? if it was at another learning website, yeah. coursera is the only one i use. but i know that there are other ones out there. and i don't know why their names are escaping me right now. do you think that you would ever pay for this course or a similar kind of online courses? i actually thought about doing signature track and the ace got recommendations for a lot of the classes i'm in. right now, the main thing that's stop me is - other than university of louisville, none of the schools i may be returning to later this year would take ace credit. ok - would take the credit. let's see. how many hours would you say per week that you spend on this course? at least three. it's kind of all over the place. i watch the lectures when i can between work. and it's often at night - pretty late at night. i know i put in two hours straight in one of the classes before. three to six maybe. three to six, ok. are you currently on track with the course? are you on week four or are you on a later week? i'm a little bit behind actually. there was a lot of personal stuff that came up in the past couple weeks that put me behind in several of my classes. i think i'm in five or six coursera classes right now. it's six. one of them just started. i haven't looked at that one yet.but besides the chemistry, i'm also in the intro to genetics, and the astro biology, the intro to pharmacy, intro to human physiology. and the epidemiology one just started. ok. are you on track with all of the courses? do you find it difficult to manage all of them at the same time? it's kind of difficult. yes. i am trying. my idea when i enrolled in all of them was, \"let me see if i can handle two jobs and roughly the equivalent of a full-time college course load at the same time.\" and i'm in a different place in all of the classes, i guess. i'm fine in astro biology. i'm actually in my final week of that one. i'm expecting to get a statement of accomplishment for that one.i'm hanging in there in genetics. that's the most interesting one to me. it's kind of fast-paced. but, i'm trying. physiology, i'm not as interested in as i thought i would be, so it's just hard to get me to focus on that one having the same issue with pharmacy. but i'm doing ok in those. and then, chemistry, i'm kind of behind in. but i'm not sure if it's that i'm still having trouble with the math or if i'm worried i'm going to do well in it, because i know at one point, i almost gave up on the book i had, because i got to about the thermodynamics point in it. i just thought, \"i don't want to do this anymore. this is where i started messing up in school.\" what week would you say that you're approximately at in the chemistry course? i know i'm in week three material. sorry, go ahead. it's ok. it has been a couple of days since i've looked at the lecture videos for chemistry. i would probably need to actually pull up where i'm at on there. yeah, no worries. what components of the course do you participate in? i know there are the video lectures, the quizzes, the discussion forums and all of that stuff. what parts are you active on? i watch the video lectures. i'm trying to make sure i watch all of them. i do the quizzes, because i do want to know how well i'm grasping the material. i don't really take part in the discussion forums. i may have posted in there once or twice, but it's not really something i look at. if it was required for the class, i think i would do it more, but...i don't know.i have online classes that are in nku, and i was the same way for those unless it was required, i didn't really do the discussion. when you watch the lecture videos, do you just watch them straight through or do you find yourself stopping and going back a lot? for chemistry, i usually can watch them straight through. she goes at a really good pace for me to just be able to take notes and keep looking up every once in a while. then some of my other classes, i have to pause them a lot, like for genetics, a 20-minute video might take me at least 30 minutes to get through, because i'll keep pausing it. for chemistry, if it's a 15-minute video, it usually takes you more or less 15 minutes to finish it? 15 to maybe 20 minutes. sometimes, i pause them but not much. have you interacted with any of the other students in the course? if i have, then i may have posted in the forums once when the class first started, but that would've been it. are you interested in forming that kind of a community with the other students in the course. is this more of a project for yourself? this is very largely a project for myself. i had a lot of confidence issues with having to leave school. i was really embarrassed that i had to leave. because it's not that i felt that i have trouble with learning things on collegiate level. it's not i can't focus on them, i get distracted. me trying to take all these classes was less for meeting people for now and more for seeing that i can do it if i tried to.although, in my genetics, when i know i did have a conversation with a couple of people in early in the class. how would you say that, having recently been in a college setting, how does this coursera learning experience compare with the in-classroom learning experience? i really like it, and i'm really glad i stumbled upon it. it was actually someone i was telling about it who put it best. it's a lot less about everything else that goes around you in college, such as, let's see, i stutter a lot, i'm sorry.i lived in the dorms when i was going to northern too, and it wasn't just about the classes and studying. there was always something else going on around me. i was in student organizations. i had to keep up with those. on coursera, it's just about me and whatever i feel like learning and i can take all the time i want to on it. it's online, i don't have to travel 30 minutes out of my way. then having been on coursera, what do you think is the advantage of going to brick-and-mortar like an actual school? i do know that a lot of employers look at brick-and-mortar in a bit of better light than online ones. i was messing around with the idea of a third job not too long ago and i did try a couple of interviews. one person interviewing me didn't really think much of the fact that i was taking online classes, i couldn't get credit from an actual institution for.i've never seen a lot of people seem to think that way. they seem to think that because it's online, because it's free, it might carry less weight. i disagree with that myself, because i can tell you a lot of what i'm seeing in this chemistry class, i saw in a brick-and-mortar school and in a book i bought for $30. speaking of books, have you purchased the textbook that's recommended with this class? i have not. i was just kind of hoping that for now, the one i have was enough to get me through it. which one do you have if i can ask that? i don't have it on me. i can't tell you what it's called unless i see it, but it's a book that i saw in a bookstore for self-teaching chemistry. it said on there that it's not recommended solely for chemistry, but that would make a good supplemental text.my bookshelf is across the room, and i think it's in there. no worries, you don't have to get it, it's ok. let's see. how does this course affected how you feel about chemistry? i still kind of fear it. i don't know. if i don't immediately get a subject, i don't like it. i guess i'm stubborn like that. then chemistry is extra frustrating me that i don't always get it the first try, because i'm actually from a line of people in my family that go into chemistry-related careers. my father is a chemist, actually.i remember i would go visit him and talk to him about this intro course that i took when i was at school and everyone just kept asking me, \"how do you not get this? it's not that hard.\" i'm not really sure why i wasn't getting it right away, but i wasn't. do you feel like that some of that fear is alleviated with this course? i think it's helping that there's not as too much pressure on me with this as there was at northern. obviously, at nku, i didn't very well. that cost me scholarships. if i don't do very well in the one on coursera, it's disappointing, but there's no actual harm done in the long run. are trying to get a certificate for this chemistry course, or you're just picking out what you want to get out of it? i little bit of both. i would love if i could get a statement of accomplishment from it, but if i don't, i'm not going to be extremely upset about it. ideally, i would get one from all of the classes i'm in. although, i'm not going to be surprised if that doesn't happen. especially like i said, the past couple weeks, i haven't been doing much with any of them. do you anticipate on being able to get a statement of accomplishment from this course? i'm honestly not sure. i did not do very well in some of the quizzes. there was one of them that i got about an equivalent of a 50 percent on and i'm not very happy about that. then there are others i got closer to 100 percent on.so let's say my average is around a 70 to 75, i think that's the bare minimum needed for a statement of accomplishment. if i keep doing good, then yeah. it's an interesting subject, and i'm very afraid of it. how would you say you studied for this course? you watched the videos, what else do you do to prepare before the quizzes? do you take them right away? i take notes as i watch the videos. i do have a binder and it's got all my classes separated in there. usually i'll take the quiz right after i'm done with a set of videos, while it's still fresh in my mind. if i can't get to it right away or i don't really feel like getting to it right away, then i just put the notes aside. i'll go over them within an hour before i decide to try the quiz.when i was in high school i didn't really study for anything. when i was in college, i probably should have, but i tried the same method. i very rarely actually studied. has this course changed how you feel about coursera in general? i don't think it's just the chemistry course, and i don't think there was much of a change. i've always had a pretty positive opinion of coursera when i first got on there.i tried to jump right into classes i actually had no background for. i am glad they have introduction classes on there so i can eventually work up to those courses. you mentioned that you're taking multiple classes at once. how many hours would you say per week, that you spend on them all together?[whistle] after biology, i know i'm spending about three or four a week on. the lectures are really quick and it's the easiest one i have. genetics is a lot longer.the last week i had really good scores on the quizzes for that class, i spent around nine hours for the whole week. i was spending at least an hour a day.pharmacy, maybe three hours a week, like astro-biology. we're at 15 hours for those three classes. then for physiology, about five or six hours. now we're at 21.for chemistry, the first week, i think i put three or four into it. it was one of those times i stayed up late to try to do everything straight through.i haven't started up in epidemiology yet. so i am looking at least 20 hours a week on everything. how would you say this compares? do you feel like you're taking classes just in college, or does it feel different than being in college? it feels very different from being in college. i know there's way more people in these classes for one thing. it's the only class that i think is set up like the online class i had in nku as an intro-to-pharmacy one.i don't mind the way the other ones are set up. but they feel less personal is the right phrase. it sounds negative and i don't mean to sound negative about it. what are some things that you think are present in the classroom that coursera doesn't offer? coursera for one thing, doesn't say a whole lot about mid-terms and other grades. i know there are grades for the classes, but that's not very emphasized.a lot of the [inaudible 22:25] i took at northern that was, obviously i'm not in person, and i only ever took two online classes at nku. i'm still not entirely used to the online class atmosphere, and when i do get on the forums, there's way more activity there than on nku.but we're also talking about a college with a few thousand versus there could be a 100 thousand people in this chemistry class by itself. do you like that coursera is less focused on grades? is that something that's appealing to you? yes it is. i really need to work back up the confidence to get back into school. if everything goes well for me financially, i will be back in, in august. i really don't want to be scared of it anymore.in coursera not being so focused on grades is helping. because if i was logging in everyday, and i just saw, worst case scenario, a bunch of f's, which i'm pretty sure i don't have in any of my classes. i wouldn't really want to bother with them anymore. it would really be discouraging, that's what i was trying to say. so coursera you would say, is something that is building up your confidence to go back to school? i think it is helping. how would you compare the difficulty of the courses? in comparison to your in class terms? i know the introduction in chemistry 1 in coursera, i'm seeing a lot of stuff on the same level as what i saw at nku. i just like the professor for the coursera class, goes in a pace that works a lot better for me.the material is about the same level of difficulty. the only class i have, that i feel like is extremely easy is, astro-biology because i feel like a lot of it is just astronomy and biology review.those were two of my best branches of science in high school and ever since. how would you compare how you're evaluated, like, these quizzes versus the exams you would take in a college setting? the coursera quizzes are definitely easier. they don't give you as many questions obviously. i don't really get test anxiety. i'm actually really good with exams.exams already feel easy to me. sometimes the quizzes hardly feel like anything. do you think you've spent more time preparing for these quizzes, or more for your in class exams? definitely more for in class exams. there are no classes on coursera for which i would say that i get really worried about the quizzes or exams. it helps if they're not in person i think.i don't have to worry about being late to class. i don't have to worry about do i have a pencil. i get very anxious and little things like that really aid at me when i was in school. you can probably tell i'm all over the place in this conversation. no not at all. what would you say are some things that you don't like about the coursera course? i really wish they had a way to be more personal with everybody. i know that's why they have teaching assistants for all the classes now, and i am glad they took that step.the first coursera class i ever tried was pretty advanced one in genetics, and i did not have the background for it at the time. there were no ta's for that class.it was just the professor and one ta. the forums were all over the place. you didn't really have many people moderating them. they still stayed on track for the discussion because everyone there had the background.when i had trouble with the class, i felt like there were more people that i could talk to. those are all the questions i have for you. do you have anything else that you would like to contribute to our conversation? i don't really think i do. i do like that you guys are getting this information. i noticed that duke university does do several classes on the website. we do, yeah. actually the intro genetics i have is topped by mohamed noor over there. i know i keep going back to that one. that one is my favorite out of the one's i'm taking right now. is it just the content of the material? or is there something about the organization? or is the teaching style? i really really like his teaching style. i like that he uses, well you guys do this for your class too, i like that there's slides and there's things i can write down in the notes.it's not like astro-biology for example. where it's just the professor talking in the video for the most part. he goes in a really slow pace which is really easy for me to get notes from that one.i'm a very visual learner. i like having things to look at that i can write down. i have to pause those videos a lot for notes, but it's ok. he does a lot of information in each video.outside of just [inaudible 28:20] squares and high school biology, i didn't really do much with genetics before. i get extremely interested.biology was always my strong point in science. actually, before i went for the biology major, i was all liberal arts stuff. which i'm still good at, i just don't like it as much. with coursera, do you feel like it's exposing you and new topics that you haven't been able to explore before? absolutely. nku does not teach astro-biology, and i cannot get into genetics without taking at least two semesters or a piece of chemistry and biology first.i felt a little overwhelmed when i was in school because i don't really have a career path in mind. i just know what i'm interested in studying.i'm just glad that i'm able to look into stuff on my own terms right now and see what i like, and don't like. how do you motivate yourself when it comes to spending time on these courses? because you mentioned you're working two jobs and you're taking multiple classes at once.how do you motivate yourself to stay on track with all of them and keep up with them? i'm trying to be really relaxed about it. my anxiety does get in the way sometimes. there have been times i would watch videos and i either wouldn't get the stuff the first time or i'd be pressed for time, or i was tired or wasn't feeling well.when i was in school and that would happen, i would just get angry and i would either shut down and not even bother with it, or i would end up forgetting everything and not doing well on my test.for coursera, i just keep reminding myself, it's ok, you can take a deep breath, get away from the computer for a little bit. come back later.i've been losing some sleep. i don't always have enough hours in the day to do all this, but, i try to take at least one day out of the week, if i need to catch up on any sleep, i do. do you feel it's rewarding for you to finish these courses? absolutely. even if there isn't a direct grade involved or even if you don't receive a certificate? so what is kind of like the reward that you feel? well, even if i don't get statements for any of the classes, i can still say that i did it and i tried. and that's a lot better than nothing.these classes all started in january for me. this past month was going to go by no matter what i was doing, but at least i can say i spent it trying to keep up with schoolwork in addition to work. and that's a lot better than saying, \"oh, i just worked. no big deal.\" so, i guess one last question i have for you is how many hours would you say that you spent working per week? well, that's all over the place. this week, i'm looking at between 30 and 40 between both jobs. and it's usually a little over 40 a week. ok. my intention in getting a second job was to break 40 because the aquarium - that's a very, very strictly part-time position. in summer i'll be getting much better hours because in summer, they get much higher attendance and they need more people around.i didn't have the second job in summer though. but last summer when i was at the aquarium, i was in the high 30s. so if i'm still at both jobs in summer, i could be looking at least a 60 hour work week, which i don't know yet if i want to try further coursera classes in summer or not. yeah. seems like a lot. i need to take a break from them. yeah. yeah, so i think that's everything that i have for you. if you have any questions or any other comments that come up in your mind at a later time, you can always contact me at dukecoursera gmail.com.i must thank you for your time and your feedback. we do try to improve the courses every time we offer it. it helps to understand who we're teaching. it's difficult from our perspective to see who our students are and what their stories are. actually, this was very helpful. thank you. and your amazon gift card - it will be emailed to you within the next week. and if you, for whatever reason don't receive it, please feel free to email me at dukecoursera gmail.com ok. ok. great. thank you and have a good rest of the night. you too. thank you so much. bye.\tC10\tFemale\tSome College\t20000-34999\t18-24\tUSA\tAmerica\tChem\n",
      "2\t...a little bit about myself and the project that i'm working on, and then i'll give you a chance to ask any questions that you might have, and then we can get started. does that sound good with you? that sounds great. my name is , and i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of the research team for the introduction to chemistry course, and i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience. in the next 30 or so minutes, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and how you feel about coursera in general. you can tell me as much or as little as you'd like, and if you prefer not to answer any of the questions, then that's perfectly fine.your privacy is important to me, so after this interview is over, i will remove your name and email address from my notes. that way, nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity. your email address will be stored separately and be used to email you your amazon gift certificate, and as soon as all the data has been collected and all the interview participants have been paid, all of that information will be destroyed as well.to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i would like to audio-record our conversation. after my notes and the audio recording from our conversation are transcribed, i will delete the recording. your participation is completely voluntary, and at any point you may choose to stop the interview.your interview will not affect your class performance in any way, and the instructor, dr. canelas, will not know whether or not you participated in this project. if you have questions about the research, please feel free to ask at any point. if you come up with questions at a later time, you can email us at dukecoursera gmail.com. the last thing is, i would just like to confirm that you are 18 years or older? yeah, i'm 18. ok, great. i guess the first question i have for you is pretty general, if you could just tell me about yourself? let's see. if you are working what kind of work you do, if you're in school what kind of stuff you're studying, just anything that you feel is relevant. i'm still in high school. it's my last year. i'm in some physics courses and some calculus ii courses and psychology, that sort of thing. i have an ap government, and i'm trying to think what else i have [laughs] . are you taking chemistry at the moment? i took it last year, no. ok. what made you decide to enroll in this course? i wanted to refresh my knowledge from the previous year, and just see if i had any gaps, that sort of thing. right. are you planning to apply this material directly to anything? like taking an sat subject test or an ap test, or any... i have mine from last year which is fine. i'm just looking to refresh myself mostly. [laughs] do you think that if this course wasn't available, would you try to seek out another way to learn this material? i was definitely interested in reviewing the material in my mind a little bit. i probably would have found something. what kind of mechanisms do you think you would have used, to try to learn it in a different way? would you have gone and purchased like books, or look for another online experience? i have some books. i think i would have read through those. are you taking any other coursera courses at the moment? at the moment i'm enrolled in one that starts, i think this week, but i haven't been active in any now. ok. have you taken coursera courses in the past before this course? i took one before this one, yeah. how did you get started with coursera? how did you learn about coursera? i learned about it through my brother, i guess. he had been taking one also and he told me that it looked kind of interesting, to check it out. how many hours do you think you spend per week on the course? well, i guess first, are you still keeping up with the course, or have you...? i'm not persistent in the course. every few weeks i'll go on it and do like a few hours, but i'm not regular, i guess. what parts of the course do you participate in? there's lecture videos, there are the quizzes, the discussion forums. what parts do you participate in? mainly the lectures. i've been doing the quizzes when i'm up to them. on the quizzes, do you spend any time on the discussion forums or not? not really. not yet. are you interested...is part of your motivation for taking a coursera course to form a community with students in your class? it's not a high priority for me. let's see. are you taking this course with anyone that you personally know? no. ok. how would you say that this course compares to the other chemistry courses that you've taken in the past? i think the depth is about the same. i'm trying to think. you mentioned that you took a chemistry course last year, was that like a regular, like a honors, an ap? it was an ap chemistry course. ok. have you taken chemistry before that as well then, or was that your first? that was my second year of chemistry. ok. what are your plans after high school? i think i want to go to college for an engineering major. is part of your reason for taking this course...does it have anything with maybe your college goals? yeah, i definitely think i might be interested in a chem.-related major. i've been interested in really making sure i know the basics well. [laughs] i guess there is a lot of kind of similar level introduction courses on coursera, why chemistry specifically, do you think you chose this one? why chemistry, specifically? mm-hmm, yeah. i really like chem, i guess. i did pretty well in it, and i liked seeing chemical reactions. i like the way that they form for batteries, for example, i did some work in that in my school i guess. i've been intrigued. would you say that chemistry is like one of your favorite subjects out of the courses? probably. i've done a lot with chem. i really like it. how do you feel about the difficulty of the course? is it given that you already have a background in chemistry, do you still find it intellectually stimulating for you, or is it kind of boring at times? i think i'm as focused on chem as that recently. a lot of it has been good and refreshing. most of it, i feel, is pretty easily solvable. apart from the chemistry courses that you've taken, how would you say that your background is in sciences, in general? i'm pretty advanced in the sciences for my level. [laughs] i take a lot of time to learn a lot. i read some of my brother's textbooks when he's done with them. i like the sciences a lot. would you consider yourself a science and math person over an english person? oh. [laughs] i definitely consider myself in that, i like to...i'm in some research programs, i was in some anyway. [laughs] i've been rather forward with that. where does coursera fit into your schedule? is it something that you do after school, or is it something that you do on the weekends, or whenever you have time? more of whenever i have a lot of time free. if i have like half an hour or an hour free, i'll put that on. has this course affected how you feel about chemistry at all? do you think that it has made you feel more positively about it, or more negatively about it? it's definitely reminded me why i like chemistry a lot. i feel like the course is good for...it's a good reminder of everything. it's a good concept and...i don't know. [laughs] yeah. do you think you would recommend this course to anyone that you know? yeah, because i have some friends who are still in chemistry and they're having issues. i might recommend it to them. how has this course affected how you feel about coursera in general? it's definitely a good reminder of what coursera is for. it's great for a good review, a good amount of knowledge pretty quickly, i think. you get to quickly process a lot of information, and it's pretty close to a classroom setting, almost. would you say that it is close to a classroom setting that you experience in school, or do you think it's very different? i would definitely think so. i think most of the teachers are of good quality, and they are able to accurately show the lessons. even though they don't have as much time, a lot the time, they are a lot quicker than some of the courses i take in school. what do you think are some of the main differences between your in-class, at school classes and coursera classes? it's definitely a lot less hands-on than....i was in a natural course, for obvious reasons. there is probably not as much focus on math and other things, just in this course, at least. i haven't seen as much as the lengthy examples that i've had last year, which might be just to keep the base, because i'm sure that would make it difficult for some people, but it's definitely missing. right, yeah. so, what is your motivation? i know that it's sort of fresh, but what motivates you to sit through an entire lecture or take a quiz? is it just, do you think it's an aspect of your personality, or are you aiming for the certificate, or what drives you? i definitely don't need the certificate. i think i've missed enough already, just being delayed, to disqualify myself from that. but i definitely am regarded by my friends as someone who likes to learn. and i do think that's the real reason. i just want to make...it's for the knowledge... right. ...more than the accomplishment. do you think that, are you more likely to take a coursera course for a review, or would you ever be interested in taking it about something that you have no background in? this is actually the only one i've used to review. the other one was some sort of behavioral economics course, and that was just completely new to me. it was very interesting and stimulating, and completely different than what i've been used to taking. right. how does it feel, being at a high school level and taking college level courses? i don't know, i feel fairly interested for it. but it's just a matter of forcing myself to get through the material and being ready for work, i guess. do you think that these courses help you feel more prepared for college, at all? 100%. i definitely think it's good, because if i have to learn on my own, or something of that sort, through the material, through third hand, third party resources. and i definitely think that's a part of coursera, and just online learning. right. do you think that, as someone who wants to pursue higher education, would you ever consider doing something that's purely online versus going to a brick and mortar school? i don't think i'd prefer that to a brick and mortar school, but i'm definitely...i feel like it. yeah. what are the things that attract you, too, because the course content is the same, right? you learn the same stuff either way, but what advantage does a brick and mortar school have over online learning? definitely, there's the hands-on degree, there's the actual experience. the being there i feel like will contribute to just being a complete and soul focusing learning, as opposed to work i do now or what i do without a school, which would be less, there would probably be less distractions. there's also, obviously, the experience i'm expecting in a school. and i don't feel like i would get the same level of rigor. i don't know if there is any actual fact to that, that's just my opinion. your impression? yeah. do you think that, are there a lot of students your age, in your age group, that pursue online learning outside of school? or go on coursera and take coursera courses? i don't really know too many. i know of...i've only heard of three other people that i know are doing it. so i want to say it's fairly limited, but i haven't asked that many people, or it doesn't come up that often. right. do you think that's more of a matter of a lack of interest among students, or a lack of exposure? like, they just don't know that it exists. it's probably a lot of both. a lot of people, i know that they lock things up online when they just want something in the blue. so i feel like, if they actually wanted to learn an entire topic or a lesson, they could probably find it online. but i don't feel like they've actually seen a site like coursera, where they would know it instantly. but then again, i feel like a lot of them have seen it, they just don't know whether or not...they just don't have the interest or the time. they expect it to be more brick and mortar, more basic subjects, and they don't feel like it's anything that would interest them. right. i feel like those students would be...they're just not concerned with it. they'd rather just keep doing what they're doing now. right. they're alone in this. do you think that...so just comparing your level of difficulty, in terms of the course that you've taken, both in the regular chem and the ap chem that you've taken. do you find this course to be more challenging in any way? or are there new aspects? it's the third time around, so i feel like i know most of it by now. so it's about the same level of difficulty. but being separate, it definitely makes it a little bit more challenging that i need to hear the things through the computer, that have not been fully incorporated into the material. there is that gap in between the material and me. maybe it's because i'm more of a visual person. i like to see and read more than i like to hear things, but i don't... you mentioned that coursera-style courses are missing the hands-on aspect. what kind of aspects do you think those are, specifically? obviously, for the chem, we're not doing any experiments. we're not creating a battery or we're not observing the effect of stp or measuring anything out. we're kind of isolated from the whole aspect of whether we can actually do an experiment.if i do a calculation wrong, i often can't instantly see whether it's my math or my process, compared to the experiments and the examples in the actual thing. there's kind of a gulf there.then there's also experiments not being able to work in a group to flush out discussion. maybe if i was in the student community, i would have that. because i'm not, i definitely miss the connection with other people that allows me to decide whether a problem that i'm having is of the group or of me, whether it's something that i'm supposed to know versus something that the group hasn't gotten up to yet, and that sort of knowledge. what would you say are some of the things that keeps you away from the discussion forums or any sort of online study group? i'm just not that focused. i have other things to do with my time and that have been occupying me. it's more of a time issue, more than an \"i wouldn't do it.\" issue. it's just time consuming to go through the posts and read all of them and find what you're looking for. is that kind of how you feel? exactly. it's a cumbersome process? right. what week would you say...that material that you are on? i'm finishing up the second week, at the moment. i'm at the last lecture, i think. that was a long week. [laughs] yeah. [laughs] it was helpful. it only took me longer than i thought it would have. just going through all the videos, do you find yourself stopping in the videos while you're watching them to process the material? do you just let them play straight through? i let them play straight through most of the time. i feel like i can get most of it on the first round, and it's a simple format. do you take notes while you're watching the videos? do you just kind of listen? i take notes. in fact, from my old [indecipherable 21:38] , the other one that i took, i think i have a notebook full of some notes on the whole topic. it was interesting. that's definitely why i still continue with coursera. if you have the time, then you would pursue the quizzes. if not, then... exactly. it's time dependent. i have other things that i've been up to. how likely do you think you are to keep taking more coursera courses? i hope i keep taking them. i'd really like to. it's going to be the issue of...i know in the next couple of months, i'm done with school, and i'm trying to get a job. i don't know if i'll actually keep taking them, but i'd like to believe i would. do you think that if coursera wasn't free, would you still be as interested? i'd probably be more focused on books if it wasn't free. i'd definitely be more likely to look at books or other things. udemy, i think, is one of them that also is an online course thing. i've been on that a couple of times. it would definitely encourage me to look at competitors. those are all the questions i have for you. do you think there's anything that you'd like to add to our conversation? i'd just like to say that even, like coursera has been a good format. i definitely think there needs to be an improvement in the lesson schematic. the websites are all jumbled sometimes. every course has a completely different way of dealing with the task...the sidebar. you know what i'm talking about when i say that? yeah, the last sidebar. some of them are like you have to go straight down. some of them are a lot more complicated or you have to go from video lectures, then there's one thing that just...i don't know. you just have to be stumbling through it all to look through everything. it's not clean and orderly. it can be confusing and time consuming just to find out what it is expected to do. definitely. would you consider yourself to be someone who's computer literate? very comfortable with the computer? i'm pretty computer literate, yeah. i think it's in odd process, because they're not laid out. i think the layout could use some work on that. do you see anything that could be improved about our course specifically, in terms of how it's designed or any aspects that you feel like are missing? i haven't seen anything missing, yet. i feel like...i don't know. i don't think there's anything missing, where i've been up to, especially compared to what i took last year, where i had to...my teacher, he'd missed out on some stuff. i remember having to go through some [indecipherable 25:05] on my own. so, more knowing towards that, in those sections where i was missing things, if that's missing again. i haven't seen any major topic gaps or anything yet. great. if you do come up with any other questions or comments at a later time again, please feel free to email me anytime at dukecoursera gmail.com. your amazon gift card should be mailed to you within a week, so probably next friday. we have our meetings every friday, and that's when we send those out.if you don't receive them, again, please shoot an email and we'll get that straightened out for you. thanks for this. thank you for your feedback. have a great rest of the day. thanks for interviewing me. you too, enjoy your saturday. bye. bye.\tC11\tMale\tLess than HS\t35000-49999\t18-24\tUSA\tAmerica\tChem\n",
      "3\t...all right. the first thing i guess we're going to do is i'm just going to tell you a little bit about myself and the research project that i'm working on, and then i'll give you a chance to ask any questions, and then we can get started with our interview. does that sound ok with you? it sounds fine. my name is , and i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of the research team for the introduction to chemistry course, and i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience. in the next 30 to 45 minutes, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and how you feel about coursera in general. you can tell me as much or as little as you'd like and if you don't want to answer any of the questions, then that's perfectly fine. ok. your privacy is important to me of course, so after the interview is over, i will remove your name and email address from my notes. that way, nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity. your email address will be stored separately to email you your amazon gift card. and after all the data has been collected and all the interview participants have been paid, all of that information will be destroyed, as well. to make sure that i understand what you tell me, i would like to audio record our conversation. that's fine.woparticipant: after my notes are transcribed, then i will delete the recording. and again, your participation is completely voluntary, and at any point, you may choose to stop the interview. your interview will not affect your class performance in any way, and the instructor, dr. dorian cornelius, will not know whether or not you participated in this research. if you have questions about the research, please ask me at any point, and if you have questions at a later time, you can email dukecoursera gmail.com. finally, i would just like to confirm that you are 18 years or older? correct.woparticipant: then we can just get started. the first question that i have for you is pretty general. if you could just tell me about yourself, what kind of work you do, what you like to do in your spare time, just anything that you feel is relevant to who you are. i had kids when i was 20. i did not have any college situation; i dropped out of high school for sort of philosophical reasons. i was an exchange student, so i was a high-performing student. but i go to high school and then had a kid and then had to go back to get work, so i went to technical school at ab tech in asheville, north carolina. ok. and went to their web technologies program. that was maybe five or six years ago. ok. 2008 2009, i graduated. since then, i live in massachusetts and i work as a programmer. my current job title is senior software development engineer. so no, i'm a programmer.i come from an academic family. my dad got a phd at duke. but i don't have a degree beyond associate. ok. having had kids at 20 without a diploma or anything, i never had time to really go to college per se. i just had enough to go to technical school and start working. and so, i'm interested in kind of backfilling a little bit in free time, and getting to do some of the academic stuff that i didn't do in the past.and so, i like coursera because i can do it sort of during my free time. i'm actually probably withdrawing from this chemistry course because the workload - i did it up to this week, but the workload is just getting to where i can't handle it.and my wife is in nursing school. and i wanted to kind of squeeze this in between working, and taking care of the kids, and attending the household while she's in school and studying. after three weeks, it's gotten to where it's' becoming less fun and becoming more of a burden.one of the things about the chemistry course, in particular, is that with a lot of courses like mathematics, i expected to learn some one week, and then that's the foundation that i build on the next week. right. so the knowledge accumulates. whereas, in the chemistry class, it feel like every single lecture is starting from scratch. every lecture, it's a new concept and you're starting at square one. and so, i find that the 15 minute lectures take me an hour to get through because i pause them and i do the exercises - which i understand we don't have homework. the exercises are in the lectures - but i pause them. and, i have to take the notes down.another thing is i didn't buy the book because it wasn't required. and i'm realizing that i really wish i had bought the book, because if i had read the chapter in the book, and then i go do the lecture, then i can follow along. but without having the book, my notes have to be my single source of information. right. they have to be my canonical source of information, which mean whatever happens in the lecture that i want to remember, i have to capture in my notes - which means note taking is a detailed and tedious process. right. rather than just keeping little references like, \"hey, remember this,\" it's like i need to actually write out the whole formula and all the definitions and everything that's being said because i don't have the book. i don't have another reference for this and it's not simple to go back and recall it again from the videos.i can understand an instructor balking at this because it seems like it might encourage student laziness, but even just the key stuff from the lectures, if it were released as a pdf or something. then i could print it out and i could be highlighting things, and then taking notes next to it. i wouldn't have to copy down every single thing, because i have to pause the video so much to copy stuff down.i was taking my notes in google docs, but when it got into the mathematical stuff, and then i switched over to libreoffice, which is formerly openoffice, because you can insert mathematical formulas. google also has a way to do that but it doesn't really work very well at all.i made one in libreoffice and then i took a screenshot of it, and then i inserted that into google docs. then i just switched to paper because i realized a lot of these things, the atom model or this, that or the other thing really does not lend itself to a word processor and it's hard to take notes that way.[crosstalk] anyway, you're just asking about my general background. basically, i have a couple kids. i homeschool them, so we're very interested in academics. my daughter has been doing kahn academy on and off since she was about five i guess. she's eight now. oh, wow. not all the time, just sporadically. sometimes even months go by she doesn't do it, and then sometimes she does it a few times in a week. we watch lots of \"nova\" online and stuff. as homeschoolers, we're always looking for resources for learning online. that's one of the reasons.i've actually taken two other courses on coursera that i didn't finish. one was a computer algorithms course where i simply did not have the mathematical background to complete it. the other was a guitar course from berkeley school of music, and it ran up against another project i was working on, the timeline i was working on this hackathon. it's like a civic hackathon thing. the timelines conflicted to where i had to drop out of that class.i have completed one mooc from a database vendor called tengen, which makes a database called mongodb. they offered a mooc and i was able to complete that, but i think it was a little less rigorous. there's a lot more programming, which is in my domain so it's easier for me to grasp. it also maybe was more example-based and was maybe less academically rigorous than chemistry class. do you have a strong background in science? have you taken a lot of science courses before, specifically in chemistry? no. i think i took chemistry once in 10th grade. i passed, but just out of stubbornness i never memorized the polyatomic ions or whatever because it just never struck me as a sensible thing to spend your time doing. i was like, \"you can always just look these things up, so why am i even going to bother with memorizing these things?\"now in retrospect i understand the importance a little bit of memorizing them. that's one of the things that actually is causing me to drop this class, is i just don't have time to make flash cards and go through everything. no, i don't have a strong background in science, outside of computer science. were you looking to take this course just to learn chemistry? is it useful for your work in any way? it's not useful for my work. i home-brew. i brew wild fermented meads and some beers with commercial yeasts, and i make fermented sodas for the kids. i like to make sourdoughs and sauerkrauts and things like that. most of that is biological processes, but chemistry does enter into it on some level as well.i wasn't sure if it would relate to that, but that's only very loosely related. i really just took this because i'm one of those types who is nonreligious and celebrates science. i asked myself, \"what does it mean to quote unquote \"believe in science?\" why aren't i taking some science classes and actually learning more? also i want to bone up on these things so i can teach my kids about them. let's see. do you think that if this course was not available, would you try to seek out another way to learn this material? i might go through khan academy. they have chemistry sections. really, the courses i'm really interested on coursera are generally more computer science related, but i saw this chemistry course, and i was like, \"oh, cool, chemistry. that would kind of fit in.\"one of the reasons i dropped these courses is because it overlaps just three weeks with the logic course i want to take. i'm already having trouble handling the workload, and i know that i am not going to be able to handle two classes at once. they are a lot. before dropping course, how many hours would you say per week that you spent on the course? the lecture's total four hours if you just play them straight through. [inaudible 11:31] spending at least 3 times that much, because a 15-minute lecture would take 45 minutes to get through frequently.i didn't much time studying, because i usually, after going through the stuff thoroughly, i would just have to go and review before i took the quiz but then i also spend time on the forum, asking questions.i'm probably going to say 12-ish hours, but i don't even think that was enough. that didn't feel enough. no, i felt like i should've been reading the book and spending time studying and doing more practice. i talked to my wife, she took a chemistry course. i said, \"i'm doing balancing equations.\" she said, \"oh, yeah, i did dozens of those.\" i was like, \"oh, i did whatever they had in the video. i did that. i don't really...\"with their more length out resources that would've mentioned, but i was like, \" i don't really want to go spend more time to see if i you know it.\" if i have the time, i would. in your schedule, it didn't fit in, right? yeah. what components of the course would you say that you participated in? i know that you watch the lectures. you mentioned that you spend some time on the discussion forum, is that correct? i was pretty active on the discussion forum. when i had questions about things, it was kind of if there were some little pain points. not being able to raise your hand and ask a question means when they say \"zinc oxide\" and they don't say the zinc two oxide, then i have to spend the half an hour googling and trying to figure out what the heck the oxidation to zinc is.finally, i'm posting on the forum and all that stuff, and finally i most of the transition metals can have all the oxidation states with the exceptions of [inaudible 13:26] , and zinc.i'm just like, \"i wish they would've mentioned this.\" because they're like [inaudible 13:31] in some note or something, but it's just one of the pain points because you raise your hand and ask a question, you can get really stuck if there is one little thing you can't figure out the answer to.what was your question?how did i participate? i did the quizzes. i watched all the lectures. i took notes. i did the exercises that were in the lectures. i would always pause a video and google stuff myself. sometimes, some of those things took me 30 minutes.sometimes, i would pause a video and doing these equations, the ones that are like, \"you have this many grams. then how many moles of the product, of this aspect of product do you have or something? this many grams in this reactant and how many moles of the part?\"those would take me a really long time. one of the things that was a real pain point for me was when there was a question that came up and i was like, \"try to figure it out yourself.\" then it was actually explained right after. sometimes, i would try to do it three times and couldn't figure it out. i'm looking on google and stuff. when i press play, i'm like, \"shit, i wish i had just pressed play. i would've figured out.\"after one or two tries, i'm ready to get the explanation. it will be useful if they said, \"if you can't this, we're going to go over it. we're going to go over them.\" some of them, we didn't go over. some of them, we did go over. the ones we didn't go over, i want to make sure i solve it. once we do go over it, if i've been working on it for 20 minutes, i get it, i'm ready to move on and figure out what i'm mussing.quizzes, lectures, forum. basically, pretty much all aspects of the class. i did not do the advanced stuff, and i did not go through any of the links out to additional practice. i didn't do the advanced problem sets. that was more of just a time constraint, right? extra [inaudible 15:25] resources. time and intellectual. some of these quizzes, like the week three quiz, i was just like, \"i don't know if i'm going to pass this thing.\" i ended up getting 11 out of 12 or 11 or 12. i got 11 out of 12 but more kind of 11. at least one of the questions, i just had to guess on, because i couldn't figure out how the answer was arrived at. do you feel like material that you have gone over; you've mastered it to some extent? do you feel comfortable with that material or you do still feel shaky on it? more practice would make me feel like i had mastered it. i just feel like in this chemistry class, and it's maybe just a chemistry thing. we cover so much desperate material, so fast that \"no, i don't feel like i mastered it. i just write down and learn it just well enough that i can get through the quiz.\"you really stop and spend the time to fully understand each concept, because there's just no way. you just don't have the time. i talked about my wife, who just took the chemistry and she says, \"a lot of these things, you just kind of got to take them on faith for now.\"i don't see taking things on faith. to me, that does not feel like i am having mastery of the content. it feels like i'm just trying to memorize the rule so i can regurgitate it and repeat it.i would say my learning style is go slowly as i need to fully understand the concept, so i can basically recreate the concept, if needed and that i don't really need to memorize anything, because i can just logically put it back together if i need to. i couldn't do that in this course, because there was just too much stuff. i couldn't take the time to fully understand things, because i just needed to move on to the next thing. did you ever find it difficult to kind of separate what were the most important concepts from the less important concepts? yes, that did happened sometimes. i'm trying to think of an example. some of things like when they're listing out rules like for solubility rules, the oxidation state rules, i was like, \"it's solubility rules, ok.\" then it will be like, \"now, we're going to do into stuff of them. i was like, \"oh, we're actually supposed to write all these.\"there were some things early on. i was taking notes on the historical aspects of chemistry and who started this stuff. then i was just like, 'this doesn't really help me understand chemistry concepts.\" let's see. were you interested in forming a community with your coursera peers? yeah, potentially, if they're in my area. in terms of out of my area, not particularly just because i have enough online groups that i'm a part of. only if there were local? if i'm never going to see the person, i'm not really that interested. are you taking this course with anyone that you personally know? no. i will say however, in regards to your last question, i like the forums. i like the idea of interacting with other students and making it feel more like you're in a group. i'm not going to form a community, as in we're going to stay in touch after this course. just being able to discuss things with them? yeah. were there google hangouts in this course? there weren't. uh-uh, but we're thinking about implementing them. oh, ok. do you think that would be something that's helpful? that would be cool if you could manage it. how many people are involved in this course, like 10,000? a couple thousand. i think google hangouts maxes out at 16 or something, and then you could just add viewers. i don't know if the mechanics of google hangout would work for your use case. i think it would be useful, absolutely. i would love to be able to raise my hand and ask questions.now, i understand that when you're paying nothing for a college course you can't expect the full experience because there are 2,000 people and there's one professor. i do appreciate the professor and the assistant. the community tas? well, the community tas, but i feel like there was somebody who had a title that sounded higher than community ta. it sounded like there was somebody who was associated with duke who was an assistant person who was also active on the forum, at least early on. i appreciated that. being able to see their presence on the forums? when i take a coursera course, i don't expect direct attention from a teacher or from an instructor. my understanding of the contract is you're getting this for free. all your things get evaluated. you crowdsource the things that aren't multiple choice. you crowdsource the evaluation and then you rely on peers for help. the fact that dr. cornelius is waiting for the forums i think is really great. i don't think she has to do that. have you taken any other online courses? you mentioned that you had, right? i've taken two. the algorithms class, i got through one week and then i had to quit. i contacted the professor about this, but in my opinion it did not adequately list the prerequisites. they said, \"oh, you don't need math.\" then i looked at it and i had a friend, another software engineer walking me through the concepts.he helped me understand the problem at hand, but i was like, \"you need a ton of math to know this.\" they should have said, \"you need to take college calculus before you take this class.\" that one failed because of academics. the other i was having a good time in but i quit because of scheduling. then one that was offered by a software vendor, not from an academic institution, i did complete. do you feel like there should be additional prerequisites to the introduction to chemistry course, as well? or do you think that somebody with no background knowledge in both science and math can make it through? even just basic algebraic concepts like solving equations with multiple variables, solving multivariable equations, that one i was able to work out on my own just because i remembered how to do it. the one about cross multiplying and dividing, that rule -- which is again a pretty simple concept, but you have to know it or else you're stuck -- that was one that i had to just pause for a second and say, \"what is this cross multiply and divide,\" and check and say, \"oh yeah, ok. i remember that now.\"i'm not practiced with math but i'm pretty good with math. i do programming, and i don't do a lot of low level mathematical stuff, but basic math goes with me a lot. i would say that if somebody came along in this course and they had never taken algebra, they would be in trouble. solving the, \"you have this many moles, and how do you get to this other thing?\" i think that there's no way somebody who hasn't taken an algebra course, i think they would not be able to do it. do you think that after taking this course, how likely are you to take more chemistry courses? i don't know that. i'm not sure chemistry is my cup of tea. in the computer science, and in this logic class i'm going to be taking soon, the basic building block is a one or a zero, or a true or a false bullion value and things build from there.really everything is eminently logical, well, to a certain extent. when you get into electrical engineering aspects, then it becomes a little more murky. for the programming i do everything is very mechanical and logical. in chemistry it's kind of the opposite. there are a million things to remember and every rule has a dozen exceptions. because it builds off of not a thought experiment but actual real world stuff, there's just so much stuff.i was talking to my friend, a software engineering friend who has a lot more degrees than me. he was saying one of the reasons he has trouble with chemistry is, for one, there's lots of exceptions to things. for two, he says there are underlying fundamental rules for how you calculate these things, but a lot of times in chemistry classes they don't get to those fundamentals because they're too complicated.what they give you is rules that generally work in practice but have lots of exceptions. his take is if you understood the fundamental underlying concepts here, you wouldn't have to have a rule of thumb with a dozen exceptions. you would just be able to, if you understood the concept better. that is tough for me to have a lot of places where i don't really understand the concept; i just have a big list with a bunch of exceptions.if i go back to college i will definitely take chemistry. i don't know if i'll do it in this coursera format because i don't know if i can swing it in the coursera format unless i just really have some serious free time.one of the things that was tough for me, it was something that i wanted to mention while i remembered it. one of the things that was tough is it was, and i know this isn't the forum since we'll mention, it's always alarming to have a new term introduced when it has not been defined.the example, if you search the forums for valence electron, i think the term valence electron is introduced but it's not defined. people are saying, \"wait a second, valence electron? is this the same as this outer orbital electron, or what does it mean for the thing to be valence?\"there are some other concepts that i never fully understood. can you tell me, what are the units on saturation point equilibrium, ksp?[crosstalk] equilibrium doesn't have units. [laughs] i know. [laughs] which is crazy. that's the funny thing. even in our exercises it says ksp of this compound or this solution is 1.0 times 10 to the negative 12. my friend, i was asking him because he's very smart, and i said, \"do you know how to figure this out?\" because it says, \"equals the molarity of this times the molarity of that,\" and i was like, \"well, how do i figure out what those things are?\"he said, \"well, what's a unit of ksp?\" i just felt silly because i don't even know. i don't even have time to try to figure out what the unit is on this thing. i'm just trying to figure out the math and move on. anyway.i feel like i really sit on the fence with the whole saying that the book's not required. i'm kind of like, \"you don't have to have the book, but you really need to take really super good notes if you don't have the book.\" it should be like, \"if you're not using the book you should probably be reading this up on wikipedia or something.\"well, wikipedia's a terrible resource for introduction actually, because it's way too [inaudible 22:41] it's almost like if you're not reading the book, you should look through the lectures and then google the concepts and read about dot com pages on molarity or something before you watch the lectures. because i don't think the lectures alone, at least for me, were not enough for me to effectively grasp the concepts. has this course affected how you feel about moocs in general, or coursera style courses? i'm going to continue taking them. i still like the idea of them. i'm wondering if certain courses lend themselves to moocs better than others. mm-hmm, certain topics? yeah. i think things that are computer science related really strongly lend themselves because you can do lots of automated practice and et cetera. in terms of coursera, when i think about would i take this chemistry course again, if i had the book i would.it made me realize that what it says on the thing for how many hours a week you need is not necessarily accurate. the lecture lengths, it has no bearing. the video length of the lecture has almost no bearing on how long it's going to take me to watch the lecture.some are 15 minutes and they take me an hour. some are 11 minutes and they take me 11 minutes. when you're at the top of the week and you look at all the things, say, \"ok, how much time do i need to budget, more or less?\" i realize that you cannot do that by looking at the lecture times.sometimes three 15 minute lectures is three hours, and sometimes you go through them quick because they're just review. i found that that made it stressful and hard to budget time because i couldn't figure out how much actual material is in this lecture. is this one of the ones chock full of new concepts it'll take me forever to get through? again, i think having read the book ahead of time would have meant i could just go through and look at the lecture.one of the other things that i'm trying to figure out in the future to make it so i do a better job is i'm considering things like watching the lectures through one time first, then going back and taking notes so i can just take in all the concepts and then go back and try to make notes. because maybe with the full high level view of everything that's going to be discussed, then i'll have a better understanding of what's important and what to annotate.this course didn't really change my view of moocs in general. i'm just like, \"yeah, chemistry's kind of hard and i really should have the book with these things. it's not really enough to have the video.\" i think that's the biggest thing i took away from this course, was i should probably buy the book next time. which does in fact change my outlook on them, because not being free fundamentally changes my approach to these things.if this course were not free i would not have signed up. because one of the things that i like about coursera is that if there's a course like introduction to algorithms or chemistry and i don't know if i have time or the academic background to complete the course, i'd say, \"hey, just take the course. see how it goes. you can dip your toes in and if it works, it works. if it doesn't, it doesn't. it's no big deal.\" it allows me to try things out that i wouldn't otherwise try.i went to take a math course on here and they were like, \"oh, we want you to get alex, and alex...\" you know, this math system and it's 35 bucks or whatever, and i'm just like, \"well, gee. now, if i don't have time to take the math course, i just toast out 35 bucks.\"the book for this course, you can rent it on amazon, it's like 35 bucks or something, or you could like buy it. i was just like, \"gee, i don't really don't want to do that, because i don't know if i'm going to have time.\"then there was something called boundless. are you familiar with boundless? they take textbook outlines, and then they digitize them and then match them up with the free resources.they'll take the outline of intro chemistry and then they'll say, \"ok. section one, molecular. here is a wikipedia article. here is an about.com. here is a video on youtube.\" they'll back fill the entire book outline with free resources, but they charge 20 bucks for access to their thing.i thought, \"well, maybe i'll be a better deal.\" again, it's just like $20 isn't that much money, but once cost is involved, it just changes the way i approach it. now, i have to think, \"ok. i don't really want to do it, unless i'm having a much higher level of confidence that i can actually complete this course.\" great. i do plan to continue taking these online courses. yeah. are you more likely to take them to be useful in your work, or just kind of out of pure interest, do you think? a little of both. i'm taking a logic class, but it doesn't really strictly relate to my work, because i do higher level programming stuff, i don't do low level stuff. it only sort of relates to my work.i mostly do it for interest, but if i were doing it work related, i might buy one of those verified things. i have some friends who are doing like android class, and they are going to get a verified certificate, because they can actually get paid for it. i'm not going to pay to get a certificate in chemistry, because why would i bother. right. was there initial intention to be able to receive a certificate without one of your goals going into this course? or were you just interested in kind of like learning what you could learn out of it? not really a certificate. i mean i did want to. if i'm going to take the course, i'm going to do all the quizzes. i'm going to turn to the paper and get my certificate, but in terms of like verifying or paying something, like no, i'm doing it just for me mostly. let's see. i think those were all the questions that i had for you. do you have anything else that you would like to mention? no. just that i think that if they are going to say, \"oh, don't,\" you know, \"you can do this class out of a book.\" there should be some warnings, being like, \"just doing the lectures is kind of tough, you need to be prepared to take really good notes.\"or, just have dr. cornelius prepare the notes for the lectures, and just release the bullet-pointed-type notes. then, i would just print those out. i think that may have been enough. then i can watch the lecture and pay more attention to actually watching the lecture.whereas, when i have to write everything down, i pause the lecture like 10 times, 20 times to write stuff down. right. ok. well, your feedback has been very helpful. this course is actually taught pretty much in the same format at duke university, to incoming freshmen.i think a lot of the feedback that you are saying, reflects the issues that a lot of the students have as well, where they feel kind of overwhelmed by having to learn, basically a new language to take this chemistry course. when we do try to improve, that will make it more friendly for everyone to approach.we will definitely take your suggestions into serious consideration. if you have questions at a later time, please feel free to email me at dukesarah gmail.com. your final gift card will be emailed to you within the next week. does that sound ok with you? that sounds great. thank you. thank you, have a great. bye, bye. bye.\tC12\tMale\tAssociate\t75000-99999\t25-34\tUSA\tAmerica\tChem\n",
      "4\t...and then i'll give you a chance to ask any questions you might have, and then we can get started with the interview. does that sound good? sure. my name is , and i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of the research team for the introduction to chemistry course, and i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience.in the next 30 minutes or so, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and how you feel about coursera in general. you can tell me as much or as little as you'd like, and if you don't want to answer any of the questions, then that's no problem.your privacy is very important to me, so after this interview is over, i will remove your name and email address from my notes. this way, nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity. your email address will be stored separately and will be used to email you a $20 amazon gift certificate.as soon as all the data have been collected and all the interview participants have been paid, all the identifying information will be destroyed. to make sure that i understand what you tell me, i would like to audio record our conversation. after my notes and the audio recording from our conversation are transcribed, i will delete the recording.your participation is completely voluntary, and at any point, you may choose to stop the interview. your interview will not affect your class performance in any way, and the instructor, dr. knelles, will not know whether or not you participated in the research.if you have questions about this research, please ask me at any point, and if you have questions at a later time, please contact dukecoursera gmail.com. lastly, i would just like to confirm that you are 18 years or older. is that correct? yes. we can get started. so the first question i have for you is pretty general. if you could just tell me about yourself, what kind of work you do maybe, or what you like to do in your spare time, where you're from, anything you feel is relevant. so i'm 31 years old. i'm from long beach, california. and i actually graduated from law school a few years back, and now i'm a professional tutor. do you tutor in the sciences or the maths or... i do general tutoring for middle school and early high school students. i'm looking to expand that so that i can do most high school subjects, as well as sat tutoring. you mentioned that you went to law school. was your undergraduate degree also in a humanities field or was that in math and science field? it was in humanities. there's an international studies. have you taken many science and math courses before? is this course one of your earlier courses? in undergrad, i got through chemistry 200 series. then i took calculus 1. i took calculus 2, and i dropped it. what made you decide to enroll in the course? i wanted to brush up on chemistry, because next, i have a couple of students who are going to me to assistance with their chemistry work. i wanted to make sure that i still knew chemistry before the 10th graders are going to chemistry. do you think that if this course was not available, that you would look for a different to learn this material? i'd probably spend my time on khan academy instead. which is available through youtube, is that correct? no, it has its own website. it has its own website? it's a series of videos that are a lot more self-guided. what made you decide to choose this coursera course versus khan academy? i'm on khan academy, but i like coursera because it gives me a little bit of a deadline, a lot more reminder emails. it kind of has a whole course attached to it as opposed to khan academy where you kind of have to direct it a lot more.khan academy is going to the point where you can actually have it predict what you should be doing next, but that that's in the future, and it doesn't have any problems that are associated with the [inaudible 05:23] . is the discussion forums or the community of students have anything to do with your decision? are you active on the discussion forums at all or no? no. no? [laughs] i look at them sometimes. i've always been a very self-directed learning. even in law school, i didn't do study groups, and everyone does study groups. is it just you're not interested in forming a community or is it just there are too many people and it feels disorganized or is it a little bit of both, do you think? i don't necessarily form a community when it's not face-to-face interaction. even on facebook, that's better, because i know the people there. it's not something where i don't find that i get the same interactions they do one-on-one and in-person. do you think that you would ever pay for a course, an online course? probably not. i did for my bars study course that i did mostly online, and i found that to be a kind of awful experience as far as completing things. knowing myself and knowing that i don't always complete things, i probably wouldn't pay. if coursera was offering a fee, that would not be interesting to you anymore? no, because i know my schedule as a professional tutor, there are some weeks i have insane loads and some days i don't. looking to get certification from it, i just want to get through as much information as i can. how many hours per week would you say that you spend on this course? it's really hard to say. the first week, i did a lot. then i kind of stopped, didn't probably get another second wind at some point in watching a lot of the videos again. it's just i have four new students that i have been [inaudible 07:48] for. how far or long are you on the material at the moment? i finished week one. do you anticipate being able to finish all the weeks or kind of pick and choosing what you do? i'll probably pick and choose. if i get through all the weeks, that's great. i'm not pushing myself to do that, if that makes sense, if i'll just give myself anxiety if i do. do you think that in order to prepare to tutor your students is that's the only way that you're preparing in terms of chemistry? are there supplemental methods? like i said, i've [inaudible 08:37] academy. i also signed myself up for the advanced chemistry course, which is also being offered right now. i probably, next time i see a chemistry course, i will pick that one too and enroll in that one so that i [inaudible 08:55] little bit more foundation, because i don't anticipate being able to finish the class before it disappears. is a lot of the material being taught through our chemistry course redundant to you? have you learned it before? is that your first time exposure? i've learned it before, but it's good because i learned over a decade ago. somewhat like a refresher, right? new. i don't think i was taught the scientific notation rules as clearly as she teaches them. i think she's a very good teacher. i probably learned the material before and definitely some [inaudible 09:50] . what components of the course have you participated in? i know there is still the video lectures, the problem sets, the quizzes, the writing assignment. so far, i've just watched the videos. actually, i'll probably take some of the quizzes as well. i haven't done that yet. you mentioned that you're not really interested in the certificate, just getting what you want out of it, is that correct? yeah. if the certificate works with my timeline, i would've totally gone for it, but that doesn't happen. [inaudible 10:31] , because i know my week's just get a bipolar sometimes. how do you feel about the videos? do you feel that they cover enough content? do you feel that they are too many; they are too long, et cetera? actually, there's too many of them. just because of the fact that, when you have videos like this in a way that you can access them again, you're to pay a lot more attention to every single thing that's being said. [inaudible 11:07] when you're attending a live class, what happens is you can doze off a little bit, then get yourself back on track with notes and whatnot.one that i found online is that you really get on yourself if you have missed something. even though it's an equivalent of an actually week, it seems so much longer when it's online. you can go back and be like, \"oh, i need to take care of this.\" it kind of sort of expands even though it's not. do you find yourself re-watching any of the videos or going back a lot after getting through the video? yes, especially since i have adhd and dyslexia. obviously, it doesn't hurt to [inaudible 12:10] academically with the law school. what happens is if i'm in a live lecture, i also have a processing disorder, so i don't actually understand that material until i have kind of gone through it in my mind. i do not process well in the lecture.when it's online, i kind of do that during a pause or if i catch myself doing that during the lecture, that i've missed that material and then i go back and re-watch. how important would you say that coursera is to you? it's a pretty vague question, and you can choose to answer in any way that you [inaudible 12:53] . it's something that eventually is necessary for me professionally. at this point, it's not really all that urgent, so it's not that i have my list of priorities. let's see. are you taking this course with anyone that you personally know? no. no. just on your own. do you think that it will help you stay motivated if you were taking it with someone that you know? probably not. maybe we can talk some more again about how this coursera learning experience compares with your past educational experiences. we can talk about both your experiences is a brick-and-mortar and both through your online class, maybe? one of the things that i noticed about the online classes is that it's a lot harder to be an engaging teacher. i've done a couple of different coursera classes. one [inaudible 14:23] that i was most excited about was modern poetry from, i think it's the university of pennsylvania. i was super excited about that, because in college, i took a lot of poetry classes. there were just writing and there wasn't really analysis.the teacher just was so awful. his style just clashed with my style of learning poetry. there were some fundamental differences on just pedagogy issues.it's really interesting that some of the classes that i've been most interested on coursera have been because of the teachers. i took that physics class last year. the teacher was so amazing. he just knew how to do an online class. it was lots of really interesting examples. he was constantly doing physics demonstrations. that was really interesting to see.i would say the bar study class was awful, because bar study, you're expected in a month to cram everything in. when you have the ability to go back and watch the videos, you're just basically torturing yourself.it's like even it's four to eight hours of class, it will take you basically all day to watch the videos, because you're trying to learn everything. i think that's impossible.my experience is kind of been all over the place. in the other coursera classes that you've taken, have you mostly just watched the lectures or have you participated in other parts of it as well? i watch lectures. sometimes, i do the homework. there's a couple that i was really interested in that were like teachings and i participate in the discussion boards. i just didn't find that they helped very much.they seem like when you go read an article and there is all the people, and some of them are just getting sort of almost there to annoy people. that is an issue that we deal with as well. as we try to moderate the discussion forums, some people will just... it's a little bit better, but there are a lot of people just there who just \"i don't even necessarily want to have a discussion with you.\" if you were to try to use the discussion forums, will they be to get specific questions answered or to vaguely discuss on a topic or just to reach out to other people? what do you think that what kind of function would serve for you? mostly to get into vaguely on the topic until they get in-depth in the area that i find a little bit more interesting, something that's related but not expected to be covered. great. has this course affected or changed how you feel about chemistry at all? not necessarily. it makes me remember that i like teach. you've always been someone that's enjoyed the topic? yeah. when i was in high school i thought i was going to work in crime scene investigation. that was before csi was around. i did a couple of little projects where i had to go and actually meet people at the local crime scene lab.i realized that i was a bad chemist, so i decided not to major in it. all my experiments didn't exactly go right because i had problems measuring correctly, so this is probably not a career that i want. do you think that you would recommend this specific course to anyone that you know? i recommend coursera to some people, but i don't necessarily recommend specific [inaudible 19:28] . would you ever use any of the videos to help you while you tutor, or to students, do you think? i think a lot of those students that i work with, they know they have me as a resource, so they're not looking for that many resources on their own. if you're getting tutored for two hours a week and getting extra help, usually you're not going to need more than that.a lot of my students, their parents pay me to tutor them so that they can get guaranteed that a as opposed to because they don't understand it at all. great. you mentioned that you've recommended coursera to other people before. what kind of people have you recommended it to? friends or family or...? just random people, on the bus and stuff, and we're talking and having discussions about intellectual stuff. do you think that it takes a certain personality type to be drawn towards coursera? definitely. i think people, especially in my age group; they have to still want to learn. it's pretty time consuming for somebody who has a full-time job. not a lot of people who are adults are going back to school, and it doesn't have any career path drawn to learning, so a lot of adults just don't get that.i see it being really advantageous towards other countries that have the time and want to have some sort of material in english, are really into career development because they are working for ways to be professional.maybe their education isn't there in their home country and they want to understand what the american gold standard of education is. that's where i think a lot of coursera's audience is. i think [inaudible 22:11] we aren't really into career [inaudible 22:17] as much as in other countries. do you think that coursera courses, right now i feel like a lot of the courses are direct translations of university courses, which aren't necessarily the most applicable to jobs, do you think that they should be more tailored to technical skills, or do you think that its current path is sufficient? a lot of the classes that i've been most interested in have been career development. there's a whole bunch on teaching. there's a bunch of small business start-up, for some reason.i think those are actually some of the worst classes on coursera right now, just because they're interested in giving the skills, but they don't necessarily know how to deliver. a lot of the universities know which classes to put up that are more academic, and they put up the academic classes are as boring.they actually understand, when it comes to academic courses, which ones are going to have a following online and which ones are best in person. i don't think they understand that with the career development as well. do you think that when you take an online course like coursera, do you speak out in experience similar to your undergraduate university, maybe, or is it a totally different approach? given the fact that it's been a while since i was an undergrad, i don't think i'm looking for something different, but i definitely don't know what i'm looking for. i did not grow up with the online availability of college courses, or that thing. i didn't grow up with the expectation that videos would be recorded, and if i missed a class, if you go and catch the video.that happened in law school, and even then it was weird. for me, i don't know. because of the fact that i'm a tutor and looking to figure out the tutoring world, too, online courses are interesting to me because i can learn something from them and figure out how to best reach students that are broadened, i mean when i get some of those. do you think that when you're taking coursera courses, are you more likely to take it just for your peer interest for fun, or do you want them to be applicable in some way to your life? if they aren't applicable, i don't understand why i would go through the whole... just satisfying my curiosity. it's hard because sometimes i want what i want and it's obviously not going to be there. i specifically want something, but, i don't think we ever do anything that's not applicable to our lives, if that makes sense. right. it doesn't necessarily have to be something that's for your job, your work. yeah. personal life is as important as job as far as its ability goes. have you ever heard of any criticisms of coursera courses? coursera courses belong to a category called moocs, which stands for massive online open courses. they are relatively new, but they have caused a good amount of controversy within academia. are you familiar with any of the criticisms? i can guess toward what they are. i haven't really seen anything except for positive articles on moocs or the [inaudible 27:04] . one of the main criticisms, or one of the main concerns, is that they will change how higher education works by replacing or heavily supplementing the current institutions that we have. do you think that's a valid criticism, or, if not, why? i don't think that's a valid criticism because i think that if they change how it works, it's going to be a development that was going to happen naturally anyways. i think, when you look at the current students, it's way different.i was just talking to one of my students because he got his first graphing calculator yesterday and mom wanted me to familiarize him with it. at the same time, the kid had a bad day, so we weren't doing a lot of academic work. we were mostly doing talking that day about some of his life skills, which he was no doing too well with.it's such a different world for kids that are going into college now, and they're not looking for the traditional college experience because they grew up with a lot more available to them online, and just because that there's things available to them online that their work is for, doesn't mean that academia should be solidified and encased in carbonite, or whatever.i think it's one of those transitions that's happening both because there's a push for students to have a little bit more versatility, and natural progression, as opposed to the moocs being something that's changing it. i think that the change was already happening.the second reason i think that that's not going to be the case, is because there's only so much you can do after taking that online course. you don't get credit for it. i actually was having a discussion about that yesterday when somebody was trying to claim that there was a class that occurred at a college, but wasn't a college class, and was trying to claim that it was a college class.it was like, \"no.\" each class has a very specific purpose and when you have the ability of information online, employers can't see that. you can, maybe, get to the job interview and then it can be the information that you have, but when you're dealing with entry level positions you're not having deep level discussion to do.those happen after you've graduated from, not even undergrad, but graduate school. \"oh, is this person really a [inaudible 30:18] discussion?\" as opposed to, \"hey, are you qualified? ok. here's your job.\" right. do you think that, if you were to offer this course, what would you change about it, if anything? i think it's hard. i think coursera's main issue is that they're very limited as to what sort of things they can offer. they have the discussion board, they have the quizzes, they have the videos, and technically you're linked to other stuff, but there isn't any ability to have propriety information in another form than those.if you're going to have something else that you offer, it has to be kind of free and accessible to everyone if you add something else to the coursera format. for instance, i think that a lot of educational, especially in the [inaudible 31:34] levels, is going towards something different, more like a game sort of aspect to teaching learning as opposed to a quiz. that's a little bit harder to do with coursera. right, the platform is pretty stiff. it's harder because you really have to direct each thing to do and how them link together or else people are going to get lost in the coursera site as opposed to a platform, like khan academy has one, where it kind of guides you and gives you something next to do, but you can still find yourself on other sites. it's a lot easier to navigate as opposed to coursera where it's harder to navigate.[inaudible 32:43] a good platform to say, \"here's where you to go. here's something that you might be interested in,\" and give you options as far as what's next to do. you can either have it be automatically like, \"here, click this to go to the next thing,\" there's not a list of things. do you think that you would ever be interested in interacting more with a professor or the community tas? if it weren't a huge, massive online thing, probably. but [laughs] i know the professor's probably really, really, really swamped because these are way more time-intensive than your regular college class, because you have so many more students and they all want to vie for office hours. [laughs] one of the things that we're thinking about implementing are google hangouts. are you familiar with google hangouts? no. i've seen other courseras do that. it's just kind of like virtual office hours i guess you could say where either the professor, the community ta, turns on their video camera on their computer and any other student can hop on to the virtual chatroom. it's up to 10 people i think at a time. would you ever be interested in something like that? if it was something that i was really interested in as far as the subject matter, i think, if you're going to do that, the best way to do that is kind of have them either directed so you have 10 students that're are interested in the same thing. it's hard because you get 10 students and they might all really want to know different things.for me, i know that they're such a huge class that my interest isn't going to be to be one of the top 10 kids [laughs] who want to talk to the people in the google hangout site. so i don't really do the google hangout thing. because i know where my interest level is and i know that i don't really have any questions that i can't get answered on my own. i think that there are some students that don't have those resources that really need that.for me, i've always been one of those students that have been in the top of the class and just understand things very quickly. [laughs] i would find those very interesting because of the discussions that happen, but i don't necessarily need them because i know that i know things more than other students. it's kind of the same issue with discussion forums i guess, right? no, occasionally i see in discussion forums, i'll see questions that are actually interesting and i can help out if i know something that other people don't know. it's just a matter of i don't even want to click on it, because it's like, eh, i don't necessarily have anything i want to discuss. feel like interesting...some times that i've been on the discussion forums, it's been like i kind of want to see what other people are saying on this. for instance, i took a class on adhd and it was interesting to see it from psychology perspective. it was a very boring class so [laughs] i didn't go very far but it was very interesting to see the discussions on that because i had some personal experience with that.i don't think i ever contributed but there was a really interesting question, that somebody was talking about whether or not through psychology you could actually identify somebody as having adhd where it was a blessing instead of a curse [laughs] because technically you have to have it impact you in two aspects of your life. technically people who actually function well with adhd, then they can't have adhd. interesting. i think those are all the questions that i had for you. do you have any questions for me or anything that you'd like to add to our discussion? no. if anything comes up at a later time, i'm always available through our email address docoursera gmail.com. your amazon gift card should be emailed to you i think probably tomorrow, on friday. if not, definitely within the next week. does that sound ok with you?thank you so much for your time and your input. your input is very helpful and we do take it very seriously. thank you!

      "5\thi, this is  calling from duke university for the coursera research interview. hi, . hi. so the first thing we're going to do is i'm going to tell you just a little bit about myself and the project that i'm working on, and then we can get started with the questions. does that sound ok with you? that sounds great. so my name is , and i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of the research team for the introduction to chemistry course, and i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience. so in the next 30 minutes or so, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and how you feel about coursera courses in general.you can tell me as much or as little as you'd like, and if you prefer not to answer any of the questions, then that's no problem.your privacy is important to me, so after the interview is over, i will remove your name and email address from my notes. that way, nobody who reads my research is going to have access to information on your identity. and your email address will be stored separate from my notes and be used to email you your $20 amazon gift card.as soon as all the data have been collected and all the interview participants have been paid, all the identifying information will be destroyed. and to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i would like to audio record our conversation. after my notes and the audio recording from our conversation are transcribed, i will delete the recording.your participation again is completely voluntary, and at any point, you may choose to stop the interview. your interview will not affect your class performance in any way, and the instructor, dr. knelles, will not know whether or not you participated in this project. if you have any questions about this research, please feel free to ask me at any point, and if you have questions at a later time, please email dukecoursera gmail.com.finally, i would like to confirm that you are 18 years or older. yes, i am. and we can get started. so the first question i have for you is pretty general. just please tell me about yourself, what kind of work do you do, what do you like to do in your spare time, where are you from, anything that you feel is important. i worked in social work in direct services in a homeless shelter. so i'm pretty focused with school because i'm still pretty young. it's an important value to me. are you working on your bachelor's degree? i finished by bachelor's degree. while getting my bachelor's degree, i studied philosophy. and i received an honors degree in that. and i studied neuroscience and psych. so, i really wanted to take chemistry because it's fascinating and i don't just have to it. so i just wanted to study it more. and duke was a really good opportunity. are you currently working on a different degree then? no, not currently. i really feel strongly about the new platform. how it's helped me, specifically, is my education was not focused enough in physics and chem. and i'm essentially trying to catch up in that while i transition majors, from bachelor's to graduate school.from philosophy to neuropsychology requires a lot of different -- it's just been excellent. i can't say enough about it. are you pursuing your phd in neuropsychology? eventually. currently, i'm not. but, that's the goal. that's where you're headed? yeah, if i was ambitious, i guess. you mentioned that you studied philosophy as an undergraduate. then, do you have a strong background in science or math? or, is this course one of your earlier courses? i have a strong background in psych and philosophy. i do not have a strong background in science. so that's what i'm working on -- biology, chemistry, physics. are you taking other courses as well besides this chemistry course, to help you prepare? yes, i am. are they through coursera as well, or are they through different platforms? et edx, and coursera, and udacity actually. and what's the last one? i'm sorry. it's u-d-a-c-i-t-y. can you tell me a little bit more about that. i've never heard of that before. you've never have heard of udacity? no, i haven't. what can i say about udacity? it's definitely characteristically different than coursera or edx. instead of maybe the college professors...they still have some college professors there, but i find that instead of college professors, they have like professionals.they might have a high executive from google, run a class, or they might have a person with 25 years of experience in design, run the class. they have sort of industry leaders, outside of academia, running their courses. i actually very much prefer that in a lot of ways. can you elaborate a little more on that? what kind of...? sure, on what exactly? i'm sorry. on just what parts of udacity you prefer that coursera doesn't offer? coursera doesn't have the breadth, i'll tell you that. on just excellent accessibility, and it's organized very well. udacity though, i feel like it's...i really think it's extremely difficult to replicate a university classroom.i went to a large school myself, it's 40,000 people. i definitely know that kind of large university learning is like. there were some things missing. if i were to say, if an online platform, a mooc, could offer anything really valuable to me personally, i would say it'll be something closer to like vocational learning.something that gives me a set of really useful accessible skills, something that's up to date. because the loftier, more abstract concept, those are really nice to have when you have a dedicated group of students and professors and tas to work with.that's why i think udacity actually beats out corsera and edx, because it's like these things that i learn there seem to be very skill focused, very vocational, almost technical school. i've never been to a technical school, but from what i understand about that, it's seems to be more like technical school learning. it's seems like i can walk out the next day and use it. for you purposes, that just seems more relevant then. no. for my purposes, both of them are relevant actually, probably equally so. i wonder, and i look forward to seeing, but i wonder if it's impossible to make coursera...i wonder if it's much, much simpler and easier and more effective to just do it the way udacity has done it -- focus on the things they've focused on. not that coursera should change, because then there is no access to anything, that a different kind of methodology supplies.yeah, as far...how do i say that? i would be surprised if...i think the biggest challenge with coursera, is the discussion forums are just so totally disorganized. i don't know how you do it, they probably working on it.specializations is really good, i thought about that two years ago, one year ago, when i see these courses, that's more useful than one course -- three courses paired. discussion forums, i don't know if they are going to split it. they are just going to look at the demographics, analyze the demographics and put people together or whatever.i don't know how they are going to do it, but they need to do it, because a lot of questions i have, i don't trust discussion forums to answer them. that bothers me. that's actually what calls toward the audacity, too. i don't need my questions answered in the same way, because it's not focusing on the same material in my mind. do you just feel like it's the number of people that are on the discussion forums that makes it? no. like i said, i went to...my classes, upper level philosophy classes were middle concentrated, 20 to 30 people classroom. that's less. what it was is there is a sense of competition. there is a sense of personal integrity on the line. there were just competition. it seemed like more people knew they had to take it seriously.all that kind of combined into people actually in the classroom. if you're working on a lab or you have a focus problem, and you're actually going somewhere to solve it. like i said before, i was an honor student in philosophy at my school. i walked away thinking, \"what a waste of time this bachelor's degree was in too many ways?\"the students around me, i thought, they didn't try hard enough. you take that problem and you amplify many times over when dealing with something like coursera. not that it shouldn't have discussions, but i see that as a critical...oyster was the incentive to do better, where is this selectivity, or the students who actually want to do this work and the students to want to take more background. do you think part of that issue is because it's free and it's available to anyone at no cost that kind of takes away from the quality of a course? i don't know. do you think that there is a money incentive attached that perhaps it would refine the course? that's a good question. that's a difficult question for me to answer. totally, it's an open-ended question. you don't have to answer it at all. i'd like to. i just need a moment to think about. i know what you're talking about, what incentivizes the youth. more people, learners, in general. i don't know. i can tell you some difficulties that i have learned into that have gotten in the way of what learning incentives i felt toward education that have sort of been an obstacle for me, that could partly answer the question and then there's a...some of the things, being too eager, taking too many classes at once, thinking i had more time for it than i did. not being a good planner of topics i didn't know. getting a class and then wanting to expand so much more on that i kind of over extended myself and didn't have time and was not [indecipherable 14:01] .what else? what else? what else?immediate incentives, i know they're trying to do that with the verified certificates. which also has the money thing attached to it. that does, yeah. i'm actually looking into that more. for instance, in my own circumstances, i'll be applying to post baccalaureate program in pre-clinical site for next fall. i can choose to take a couple of classes at a university here, where i am right now, which i think is too expensive. it'll be maybe 1,500, 2,000 a class. i just don't think it's worth it.i can live with a community college or maybe tech school. that will be about 1,000. of course i know that the university will transfer very easily the post-back program. i'm not sure that the college will. i don't know how they'll accept credits. i have to check into that.i have even more of a question. if a program like northwestern would accept...i don't doubt the education actually, especially at lower level classes. it will be better than my local college. i wonder if they'll actually accept, they'll see, \"you took intro psychology as a science.\" which i don't actually need, but for this program, it's just like overlapping and it's annoying.i'd rather save some money and take it before the program starts if i could and i'd have to take in the program. i'm not sure that they're going to see that i took a verified certificate and transfer that to a college that i didn't attend and then accept that. that is a problem i run into. that's something that you think should be accepted, or do you think that it's not...? do i think it should? i don't know, because i am not taking tests in front of the instructor, because i am not...that's probably one of the major things that my test and homework and such are...probably test are not taking in front of an instructor. i would imagine. i don't really know their decisions for accepting the students, so i'm expecting. i just couldn't answer that. i don't know. in my mind, i would probably do better. have you taken any coursera courses before or any other moocs? i have. can you tell me which ones you've taken before? some of these, i've just taken to open them up to myself at a later time. if i want to just...the ones that...let me just think that. i have taken an anthropology class. that was edx. i've taken history of mental illness class or mental illness and mental fault. that was fascinating. that was coursera.i've taken a literature class on coursera, pete brown, that was a very good class. that class, in particular, was better. any literature class i've had at the university i'm at. i think that this is a pretty good literature, primarily at this university. do you think that you are more likely to take coursera courses for fun? do you think you're more like to take them for something, like for school or for work. i take them very seriously. they're for school and work. they have a potential. they're wonderful. they're absolutely wonderful. they're better than most university classes i've taken in my life. is it important that they apply to your life, in some way, or is it enough that they're interesting? without sounding too radical...it's been my understanding, my experience, that universities are kind of a money making machine. i think that, unless they offer relevant courses that can translate into real world productivity, that they're probably wasting people's times. it may even be going so far, they're being dishonest and lying to students.this is coming from humanities background. that's just how i felt. that's just what i thought about it. how they translate to coursera. obviously, it's free. opportunities are offered, those kinds of subjects. some of them, they do it really well. that's amazing. i think that's wonderful. just intellectual explanation, i love it, absolutely love it.i think there needs to be that. if there wasn't, i would think there was something missing, because it is a huge motivator, just the learning i do supplied here, it's got to be very, very interesting to me. i wanted to learn about rome or something that i'd like to.if you want to eliminate other expensive forms of education, then coursera needs to be very much focused on rigorous tested methods of skill development and analytical skill development.one class that particularly comes to mind actually was a...it was through uc irvine. it was intro to biology, intro to how to study biology, something like this. they way they did it was just...it was very, very good. it was case approaches. it actually reminded me a lot of working in a lab, in a neuroscience laboratory. i just thought it was very good, very hands-on, very hands-on. talking specifically about our class, how many hours would you say per week, that you spend on introduction to chemistry? i haven't actually spent any time on the class yet. i've been completely overwhelmed with a few things in my life sometimes, but i will be spending upcoming...i would guess about eight hours a week. that's what i'd say. after i finish this other class i'm taking, i would say that i'll spend eight hours a week on it.i want to really learn it. in my experience too, it's hard to learn something when you only spend a couple of hours a week, especially chemistry. will that take place just whenever you have time during the day or would it be a specific time, a regular routine everyday? it's better to do the regular routine thing. that's how it was in college. it's hard. it's difficult for me to self-manage. part of my job requires managing people, so it's actually difficult for me to self-manage myself, to manage myself, and to say, \"from 4 pm to 6 pm or something.\"that's a goal. i'm going to work towards it. as you know, with online learning, it requires a lot of skill development of just...so does university learning, they both require...how do you adapt to this new learning environment and function most efficient within it. that's definitely a set of skills.i've seen some courses on that. i haven't taken them. maybe i should, but they're not like very fun. based on your experience and other coursera courses or most, have you interacted with other peers in your class? yeah, i was pretty disappoint. i'm not pretty disappointed. i was disappointed, but some of it has been ok, but generally, some of it is good. i find that the more quantitative courses are better for interacting with my peers. are those through discussion forums or the facebook pages? what are the mechanisms that you use to communicate with them? i only use the discussion forums. you mentioned that they were disappointing. is that correct? that's correct. can you elaborate about that? what part? i can. i see some of the course that pre-core surveys and all of that. some of the surveys in the courses, my guess is that they're trying to collect statistics in order to create selection criteria for discussion forums later on. that's got to be a goal. if it's not a goal, then who the hell is running this place? i believe it is a goal.what's that? the pre-core surveys. yeah. that's just my own guess. do you think that they should be stratified based upon...is it age or education background? that's a good question. i'm not sure. who am i to answer that. age probably matters a little bit, but a lot less than something like education. experience, experience is very, very, very good. oftentimes, i just know what i know about psych, i just will not have a discussion with somebody who's only been in the classroom and studied psych, because it's not possible.i think you just probably would have to look at all of those numbers in front of you and statistics collected and just...i don't know what you'd use. i don't know how you would...i will say that...one thing that doesn't depend on students is the size of the forum. there is no way that i can go through the last 100 posts every time i go on to that.you know what though? that's exactly what i feel like this is. i feel like there are really great people with the same focus is i have in with each courses. i feel like there are people like that. i found people like that. they're just hard to find on the discussion forum, and i don't have time to pick through all of those. that is a little bit of a \"you're right, right.\"i don't know if people can self-regulate this discussion forum for more serious people. this reminds of yahoo chess. you have the beginner, intermediate, advance level players. i think people rate themselves pretty well. obviously, if go under advance forum, you will loose your time.i don't know how well people rate themselves if those kind of options were presented on a discussion forum. i'm only going to produce [indecipherable 28:27] , because they're already taking the same course. there's a lot of [?] fair ability within that though and still very much is. do you think that you were disappointed that you didn't get the questions answered that you were asking or just...? yeah, i thought they're...no, please, continue. in the manner that they were handled, did you feel like there was lack of respect and maturity? respect and maturity, no. i don't think so. i think they were...maturity, maybe. maturity, but nothing that...i'm glad that people are there and they're posting. no, maturity, not a problem. it would be great to see one, but you know what, no.if i ask you the question or if i just ask some clarification question that i found that not to be answered often enough, yes, i have. that is disappointing. look at it and say, \"hey, look, guys. i have a background in something, so i know this has got to be a good question. it's going to approach the material on a level that we could be begin a discussion with.\"i have enough confidence in some of the topics that i'm learning to make those points. i'm just a bit disappointed on the responses with that. it shouldn't be social media. university, education isn't. it's not social media. it's so popular, it is popularity contest going on. i don't know. i don't really know what dictates several hits to a discussion forum, through question to topic post.i can tell you that, sometimes, it is annoying. my solution to that has been to persuade friends of mine to take courses with me, but i've been largely unsuccessful. is that just because people are busy or they're unfamiliar with the topic? i don't think people take education seriously enough and i don't think they love it, a lot of people. i think they want to look impressive in front of their boss or in front of whoever and make a quick what do you think. also, i wonder if this has to do with incentive. i don't know. i just don't know. if the incentives were greater then we all would be more inclined to saddle up and take the course.i don't know that that is the answer, but that's certainly worth considering. i don't know. it would help you stay motivated and stay focused on the course if you had a group of people you were taking it with, do you think? stay motivated and stay focused, yes. even more than that, it would help answer my questions. it would help answer my questions. i think, at this point, i can pretty much stay motivated and stay focused myself, to a large degree. i still struggle with that. definitely still struggle with that. to not have people to discuss these things with.i don't live in the suburb, i live in a university city. the people that have been very...if i meet other students, if i'm around some of my friends who are students and they have some free time out of their schedule, maybe they're pursuing masters or bachelors at that time, then those people are excited about education. the university does seem to excite people about education.there's something about being in a university, and being in a big one, and it just seems to make people really excited about learning. i don't know what it is. it just does. it's exciting. i agree with that. i don't know how you replicate that. that's all the questions i really had, unless there's anything else that you feel like i should know or anything else that you want to add to the conversation? give me just a second to think about what we talked about. a lot of this just requires brainstorming or focus groups or something like this. one thing that might help people stay more on-task is if the classes occurred on a specific hour and there were incentives for taking that class at that hour.maybe the same lecture could occur either monday, wednesday, friday or tuesday, thursday, saturday, something like that, twice a day and you could get incentive points for doing it. it wouldn't necessarily hurt your chance of getting a significant if you didn't do it at that time, but if you did...i don't know what the incentive would be, but if you could help with scheduling. providing a more structured schedule versus...? again, why would people even follow your structure? what would be the bonus? is it a live class? is that one of the bonuses? will there be tas available at that time, google hangout, or is there some other incentive? i don't know. i don't know what the incentive would be. i think that would help me.i could see that helping others, too, because that would be more like have a daytime education and a nighttime education type scenario.that might help me to stay on top of it, just to have something real instruction in my life. then, of course, the opportunity to take it at any time that you want to. i don't know. it's just an idea. i don't know. i hope you've got what you've needed and picked my brain. i really am passionate about this stuff and i see it as the future. i think it's extraordinary. your input is very helpful. we probably are going to offer this class again in the fall, as well, and the spring. every time we try to make it a little bit better, a little more suited to the students, so your feedback is very helpful. thank you for your time. let's see. your amazon gift card will be emailed to you most likely this friday, but, if not, definitely within a week.does that sound good with you? that sounds absolutely fine. thank you. if you have questions at any point, feel free to send an email to dukecoursera gmail.com. thank you. have a good night.\tC14\tMale\tBachelor\t<20000\t25-34\tUSA\tAmerica\tChem\n",
      "6\thi, this is  calling from duke university for the coursera interview. cool deal. how are you today? good. how are you? i'm good. so the first thing that we're going to do is i'm just going to tell you a little bit about myself and the project that i'm working on, and then i'll give you a chance to ask any questions that you might have, and then we can get started with our interview. cool deal. so my name is , and i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of the research team for the introduction to chemistry course, and i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience.in the next 30 or so minutes, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and how you feel about coursera in general. you can tell me as much or as little as you'd like, and if you prefer not to answer any of the questions, then that's totally fine.your privacy of course is important to me, so after this interview is over, i will remove your name and email address from my notes. that way, nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity. your email address, however, will be stored separately in order to email you your amazon gift certificate.after all the data has been collected and all the interview participants have been paid, all of that information will be destroyed, as well. just to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i would like to audio record our conversation. after my notes and the audio recording are transcribed, i will delete the recording, as well.finally, your participation is completely voluntary, and at any point, you may choose to stop the interview. your interview will not affect your class performance in any way, and the instructor, dr. knelles, will not know, whether or not, you participated in this research.if you have questions about this research, please ask me at any point, and if you have questions at a later time, please contact me at dukecoursera gmail.com. lastly, i'd just like to confirm that you're 18 years or older. is that correct? yes. then we can get started. so the first question i have for you is pretty general. if you could tell me about yourself, what kind of work you do, what kind of academic background you have, et cetera. actually, i'm 39. just turned 39, actually, over the weekend. happy birthday. my degree's actually in chemistry, but it's been a while. i got a degree in chemistry at east carolina. as far as intro to chemistry, freshman chemistry type stuff, it's really been quite some time now. i'm really pretty much taking it more of a refresher, and i just thought it was going to be fun.it is, but ill tell you one thing. it's heck of a lot more informative and more involved than i expected. it's good. that's kind of what i wanted to get out of it. it's definitely a lot of work.for industry, what i do for work, i work at a caterpillar dealership. they have the oil analysis lab. what is it is that any time they changes the oil or work on a machine, they'll take the oil sample. it's more of a preventative maintenance type stuff, the sample. we pretty much can tell whether there's something wrong with the machine or about to go wrong with the machine. you mentioned that your degree is in chemistry. is that just your bachelor's degree? yes. how would you say that your background is in science and math? would you say that you have a strong background, a moderate background, and a weak background? pretty strong background. are you comfortable with the math that's required for this course? yes. you mentioned before that you chose to enroll in the course just as a fun refresher. is it directly applicable to your work setting in any way? a little bit. did you feel a need for it? for the most part, not really. it comes in handy. it's one of those things where, usually if you don't remember something, you go, \"hey, remember how you do this part?\" usually, someone in there is going to go, \"oh, yeah, that's how you do it.\" for the most part, it's not critical, but it's useful. not critical but kind of helpful. how did you learn about this course? i think, i was just browsing through the upcoming courses. i stumbled upon it. have you taken other coursera courses in the past? yes. this is my 11th. i'm taking my 10th and 11th right now. have you successfully completed all those courses or did you just kind of pick and pull out the parts that you want to get out of each of those. i've completed, actually, i think there was the genetics one that duke was offering that i ended up dropping not so much that it was difficult but it was just one of those things where it just wasn't working out for my schedule. another one of those it was a little bit more involved that i didn't really want to invest the time in that one. but the rest you've done. just about every one that i've enrolled in, i've gotten a certificate. have those mostly been in the science and maths or have they been across the board? they're pretty much everywhere. a lot of them were just across the board, really. can you name of some of the courses that you've taken? one of them was \"listening to world music,\" \"songwriting,\" \"beginner's guide to irrational behavior.\" that are yelling. that one's awesome. that's the best one, i think, i've taken.i'm actually taking a really good one right now, university of alberta, \"dino 101.\" that's a really fascinating course.what else? i'm trying to think. \"sports and society,\" another duke one. seem to be a lot of duke one that's good. yeah, duke is involved in coursera a lot. it worries me being a carolina fan that i'm taking all these. let me see. that's all i can think of. do you think that if this specific chemistry course wasn't available would you actively seek out another way to learn this chemistry material or is it just non-essential in that way? when it comes up, i probably would just look it up just online but, again, with this one it covers a lot of other stuff that i don't even really remember. would you ever pay for this course or any of the other courses that you've taken? yes. you would? actually, a lot of them, i look at and i go, \"i really should just to give back, just take the signature track.\" it's one of those, with signature track, i don't know if it's a matter of...i know they look at your patterns and stuff, i don't know whether. i take most of them on my ipad.sometimes, if i've got to go on the desktop, if it's really necessarily then i might get on there but that's what really keeping me sometimes from doing the signature track because i don't know enough if they require to some degree of getting on a laptop which wouldn't be much of an issue but it's not as convenient but yes, i definitely would. how many hours would you say that you spend on this course per week? this course, that's interesting right there. let's see. i was actually behind the first week. i don't think i spent that much time but last weekend, no less than four hours on week two material. then this week, i would say, at least three hours.i'm a week behind being that the deadlines are as such. i did the advanced problems this past week. it might actually be pushing towards four hours also. maybe about three and a half hours on average so far. three and a half hours on average. what components of the course do you participate in? i know there are video lectures. there's discussion forums. there are the quizzes, the problem sets. for the most part, right now, i've done all the video lectures and then the quizzes, and the advanced problem sets. actually, that base problem set, i just did the week one and two yesterday actually. it took me one try. i was actually pretty proud of that.the discussion boards, i haven't really gotten on there as much. i think, for the most part, more so, like i said, it's more for a refresher for me. i'm not sure how much i'm going to participate on that aspect of it, as far as, i'm not really going to get on there unless i have to.there is going to be, isn't there a paper? correct? there's a writing assignment, yes. writing assignment? yes, most likely i'm going to do that one. that one i think may be coming up so i'll be doing that one soon, but, yes, pretty much other than the discussion forum, nothing else. i know that you mentioned you hadn't been on the discussion boards. i'm guessing you also haven't really interacted with the other students in the class very much? no. are you interested in forming that kind of...like an online community, like an online study group or just more of a project for yourself? no, it's more a project for myself. for the most part, i'll get on there if i have a question i'm trying to figure out, maybe. if it's something that i can't figure out, then i might get on there just to see how they solve a certain problem, or whatever.on the other courses, i've used it. i've utilized it. in this one, so far, no. not saying that i wouldn't, it's just so far it hasn't really been something that's come up. i probably should have used it today, because the week three quiz drove me nuts in that. i knew the material, but one way or anther i got 9 out of 11 retries for some stupid reason or another.some of that, i don't know. that part probably shouldn't even be discussed on there, anyway, but sometimes certain suggestions maybe on certain what ways to solve something. sometimes, a lot of it is the formatting gets tricky for entering responses and stuff. i think there were a couple in there, where i'm pretty sure the answer is correct. it's just the actual maybe rounding part that got me i'm pretty certain, because i checked and rechecked, and i'm like, \"there's no way.\" then certain other ones that i missed is just silly, just forgetting certain steps in there. for the other classes that you mentioned that you have been active on the discussions forums, were they also just to get the questions answered, or was it...? some of it was to get the questions answered, and then there's certain ones where like there was one on listening to world music that for a good portion of it. it's based on one of those classes that you take to get you thinking, about what you're listening to and how you view something. so it was good to see what other people's takes were on it. i guess for more topics that are thinking-based versus chemistry, which is kind of solid? mm-hmm. how important would you say this course is to you? that's a very vague question that you can choose to answer in whatever way you like. it's fairly important, because with my degree sometimes it's one of these things where you go, \"you know, it's been so long.\" so certain things use...it's just a fact of life really where you go, certain things you use and certain things you don't.i always feel like it's sort of silly that i have that degree in certain chemistry stuff, in general. if someone goes, \"hey, how do you figure this?\" and then you go, \"um...\" because you don't use it. when i took freshman chemistry it was '97 so it's really been forever. i do think it's important. how important? fairly important, i would say, but not really critical. you are working towards the statement of accomplishment of that, is that correct? yes. i'm hoping to get the one with distinction. so far so good. how would you say this coursera learning experience compares with your past educational experiences in a brick and mortar classroom? it's very good, actually. i've been very impressed with how much material's been covered on it. it's a nine-week course, correct? yes, i'm definitely expecting the rest of it to go about the same pace, so i think i'm going to get a lot out of it.well, most of it, really, should be a refresher, but to be quite honest there's certain parts where i go, \"you know, i didn't look at it that way, or that wasn't quite the way it was shown to me or explained to me.\"so certain aspects of that, i'm actually really glad, and i don't know whether it's just my way of...i'm not sure if i'm just more mature now to handle it more so than before. some of it seems like it should be easy, really, but...i'm impressed, definitely. like i said, when you asked me whether i would pay for it, yes. having seen what parts of it it covers and how much it covers, yes, i would.as far as ecu, we've had really good classes, but, again, it's one of those freshman year stuff versus now. it very well just might just be maturity level. but, yes, it's a very good course i feel. when you were first going into starting to take coursera courses, what were you expecting? were you expecting an experience that is directly translated from a college classroom, or were you expecting something that were different? i didn't really know what to expect when i started taking it. my cousin actually posted it one day, and i guess she was taking some for work, some sort of certificate type stuff for work.i just saw the link, and i started looking at the course offerings, and really that was 2012 around midyear. i didn't really know what to expect. i was impressed with some of the offerings, but it's gone leaps and bounds what they had then to now. but, yes, i didn't really know what to expect. has this course changed how you feel about coursera at all? no, not really. or about chemistry the topic, do think? no. it's something that i've always been interested in so that hasn't really changed. do you think this course is suitable for someone without a science and math background? i think so, because the way it's broken down were, you have the advanced problem sets. if you want to tackle those to get with accomplishment, with distinction, i think so. i do think some level of exposure, at least, to the sciences would help, but i think the pace-wise is pretty good that it covers a good bit of the building blocks. who would you say is, do you think, the ideal target audience for this course? the ideal target audience. freshmen year. incoming freshmen? incoming freshmen, but then anyone really i would think that would be interested in chemistry, pretty much fresh...i'm thinking maturity level was...you know what, i take that back. i would say, from 11th grade, because it's not really...most of it really some of the stuff that we've learned around 10th grade. maybe someone who is mature enough around that but freshman year in high school, maybe it's a little too early. it does cover a lot. it's just depends. general, i would say 11th grade, all the way up. do you think there is a certain personality type that is drawn to these coursera courses, or that is necessary to succeed in the courses? i think so. you have to be at least, to some degree, a little bit of a nerd to really commit to the nine weeks, because it is a good day to work. it's not awfully difficult, it's just lecture was...week two, that's three hours worth that just the lectures alone, not even actually doing the quiz or if you're really going to pause it and take the time to solve certain problems and stuff. i do think that takes a good bit of commitment. some people might just not be ready to handle that. when you're watching the video lecture, do you usually watch them just straight through or do you find yourself pausing and replaying a lot of the parts? i'll pause. i'll pause and i'll go back sometimes when i'm...because there are certain parts where i'm like, \"i know exactly how to get there, and now i get to a certain part.\" sometimes, it doesn't work out that way, but sometimes there's a certain part where you go, \"wait, wait, wait. hang on, hang on. let me get back, and what was that equation again?\"now, it's like when i watch it, i'll usually have a pen and paper ready. i like the way i follow along like i would, if i was in a regular classroom setting.that's what's funny with...this is actually one of the first courses outside of the beginner's guide to irrational behavior where the coursera class that i'm taking actually somewhat corresponds at least closer to the brick-and-mortar.in the brick-and-mortar, when you have a week's worth of stuff, it'll be a three-hour class, so you go three times a week for an hour. if you have a coursera class for the most part, that you spend a lot more watching the videos for anything passing hour and a half. usually, it kind of feels really long.it was a little bit of adjustment, because i've been so spoiled with some of these classes where you might watch 30 minutes to an hour of video. that's it. you might do a paper here and there. there might be a longer quiz or there's something that you got to figure out, but yeah, that was a little bit to adjust to. despite those things, how do you motivate yourself to continue with a course? it's got to be just to learn it and to focus on, \"hey, i want to finish this. i want to finish what i started.\" the one with distinction, it's just another one of those feather in the cap. another thing, obviously, is you tackle those, you learn a lot more than. you get more out of the course.most of it, really, as far as staying motivated for it, just the focus of, a, i'm going to finish what i started. what is the reward that you feel when you finish these courses? they don't translate to any direct school credit, not that you need it. they don't translate into a raise at work. what is the reward that you feel? it's just knowing that you took the time to finish, follow through, pretty much. do you think that's an aspect of your personality, in general, that you tend to...? absolutely. the one with genetics, i hated dropping that class, because before then, it's like every single one that i've started, i've never dropped. i really hated doing that. it's just one of those things you will see to do that, or actually just take the time that i didn't actually have for it.sometimes, i'm bending it, that i'll take it some other time that it's offered rather than get a bad score. this is actually a better plus. if the object really is to learn it, if i started taking it, i wasn't into it. it's kind of would be pointless to keep going with it.the reward's pretty much just to follow through. personality-wise, definitely. so far, do you think that this course is doing for you wanted it to do? you wanted, it's like kind of a fun refresher. do you think that it's meeting those expectations? yes. i'm enjoying watching the videos. i've actually embraced the time that it takes to watch them now. the week two, i was like...last weekend, to see super bowl weekend, i got lazy. i was like, \"weekend.\" i was like, \"well, you know...\" i got that and then sunday came and i was like, \"ok.\"that's one thing too. i might be one of these people who do not pay focus on it follow through what...sometimes, i'm a big procrastinator as well. in this class so far, i'm going to get ahead at some point. it's just that now, i'm content, submitting it when it's due.it's tough sometimes. just committing to the time, really. those are all of the questions that i have for you. do you have anything else that you'd like to contribute to our conversation? no, not really. i really enjoyed the videos. i really think they're very well done. i like some of the humor in there where dr. knelles, professor knelles, messes up on something that she said that pause and they'll say, \"hey, i really meant to say this. i really...\" sometimes, that's pretty refreshing.just wrap at the [indecipherable 26:49] like, \"oh, it's got to be absolutely perfect, which...\" in a classroom setting, let's face it. it never really is.now, that's pretty much it. i really enjoyed taking the class. now, i just got to quit procrastinating and waiting until the weekend to do it. if you come up with anything else at a later important time or have any other questions, i'm always available via email at ducoursera gmail.com.your amazon gift card will be emailed to you within the next week. for whatever reason you don't receive it, then just, again, feel free to shoot me an email. we'll get that figured out for you. cool deal. i enjoyed talking to you, claire. thank you. have a good night. you too. bye. take care. bye, bye.\tC15\tMale\tBachelor\t50000-74999\t35-44\tUSA\tAmerica\tChem\n",
      "7\ti'm just going to tell you a little bit about myself and the research that i'm working on, and i'll give you a chance to ask any questions that you have, and then we can get started with the interview. does that sound ok with you? that's fine. my name is , and i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of the research team for the introduction to chemistry course, and i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience.in the next 30 minutes or so, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and some questions about how you feel about coursera in general. you can tell me as much or as little as you would like, and if you prefer not to answer any of the questions, then that's totally fine.your privacy is very important to me, so after this interview is over, i will remove your name and email address from my notes. that way, that nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity. your email address, however, will be stored separately and be used to email you the $20 amazon gift card.after all the data has been collected and all the interview participants have been paid, all of the identifying information will be destroyed. to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i would like to audio record our conversation. after my notes and the audio recording from our conversation are transcribed, i will delete the recording.your participation is again completely voluntary, and at any point, you may choose to stop the interview. your interview will not affect your class performance in any way, and the instructor, dr. dorian knelles, will not know whether or not you participated in this research.if you have any questions about this research, please feel free to ask me at any point, and if you have questions at a later time, please contact dukecoursera gmail.com. finally, i would just like to confirm that you are 18 years or older. is that correct? that's correct. we can get started then. so the first question that i have for you is pretty general. if you could just tell me about yourself, what kind of work you do, if you're working on a degree at school, anything that you feel is relevant to this interview. i'm actually a research scientist for the federal government. i work for the national institute on drug abuse. i do pre-clinical research on drug abuse. can you tell me about your academic background -- what kind of degrees you have? i have a bachelors from the university of missouri and then a masters and phd from american university in washington, dc, in experimental psychology. what field was your bachelor's degree in? psychology and mathematics. how would you say that your background is in science and math? would you say that you have a strong background, a moderate background, a weak background? a strong background. you've taken many science courses, prior to taking this course. is that correct? a very long time ago, yes. what is your background in chemistry, specifically? i had chemistry in high school. i also took an introduction to chemistry as an undergraduate student, but that's all the courses that i've had in chemistry, and it's been a long time. what made you decide to enroll in this course? my work puts me in contact with a lot of chemical structures, which i don't really understand. i've tried to teach myself, but i've learned that i really need to get the basic background before i can go on to learn a little bit more about what's going on with the various structures and how they are developed and produced. if this course was not available, is there another way that you would try to learn this material? i tried to do a little bit on my own, and not much success. the only other option i would probably have would be taking a course at the community college. i probably wouldn't do that, just as a result of the time that it would take me to travel to that course. this is very convenient for me. when you try to learn the material on your own, what did you use to try to learn the material? i bought a book that was chemistry for biologists, that i would try to look at and learn on my own, and wasn't very successful at it. what were the difficulties that you ran into while you were trying to learn on your own? it's just that i didn't have the introductory background out of it. a lot of it was foreign to me to begin with, or it was more advanced than my background would allow me to really understand. how many hours do you feel, per week, that you spend on this course? the first week wasn't too bad. the second week was quite a bit. the lectures themselves were almost five hours. then the third and fourth week haven't been as bad. but i would guess i'm spending anywhere from five to 10 hours per week. and are you currently on track with the course? yes. what components of the course do you participate in? there are the video lectures, the quizzes, the problem sets. what parts do you participate in? i've watched all the video lectures, and i've done all the quizzes. i tried the first problem set, and i found it not particularly relevant to what we were trying to learn. it seemed like it was a little off-topic, so i sort of gave up on it. it was very long, and it was taking too much time, so i just sort of bagged it in the middle. i've also looked at the forum, though i haven't actually participated in the forums. how do you feel about the video lectures? do you feel that they're too long? do you feel that they're helpful? i found them pretty helpful. again, the second week seemed like they were very long. it's hard for me to remember back to my college days and how many hours i was spending in lecture, but that seemed like it was excessive, the second week. but otherwise they've been fine. do you usually watch the videos straight through, or do you find yourself rewatching and replaying parts of it? i watched them all straight through for one time, and then i go look at a textbook. if there's things i think i'm having troubles with, i'll go back and rewatch the lectures. are you using the textbook that you had mentioned before, chemistry for biologists, or are you using the one that's recommended with the course? no, i bought the one that was recommended. do you find that to be helpful? yeah, although it's sometimes difficult to understand which part of the textbook i need to look at. i have to figure out what she's talking about and where that is in the textbook, but it hasn't been that difficult. i've been able to follow up for the most part. have you interacted with any of the other students in the class? no. when you go on the discussion forum -- you mentioned that you looked at them briefly -- are you looking just out of curiosity, or to get any specific questions answered, or to form a community with any of the peers? no. usually, i go on after i've taken a quiz and there was one particular thing i had difficulty with, and trying to find out if somebody else was having the same difficulties and to see if i could get an answer to the questions that i was having. so far i've been able to find something that was helpful, so i haven't had to actually ask my own question. but you're not particularly interested in forming a study group with any of your peers, or anything like that? no. are you taking this course with anyone that you personally know? no. is that something that you would be interested in? do you think that it would help to take the course with someone that you personally know, or just more of an independent project for yourself? this is more of an independent project. i work better that way, anyway. how would you say that this coursera learning experience compares to your past educational experiences, both in the classroom and out of the classroom? again, i've been out of the classroom for almost 40 years. so it's hard for me to remember. it's a totally different experience, for sure. i think the advantage of this is that i can go back and rewatch lectures, which is nice. i never had that opportunity when i was going to school, so that's good. and also being able to do it on my own schedule.the downside is that i can't go into the professor's office and ask questions directly to the professor. when you were first signing up for the course, were you kind of expecting the course to be an experience that's similar to your college experience, or were you expecting just something totally different? i was probably expecting something totally different. you mentioned that it would be helpful to be able to interact with a professor directly. have you interacted with any of the community tas? no, i haven't. do you find yourself having a lot of questions that you can't seem to answer? is that something that's difficult? no. so far, i've always been able to figure out what i'm not understanding. how has this course affected how you feel about chemistry? i'm finding it pretty interesting, and more interesting than i maybe remembered from my college experience. that may be more related to my...i'm finding it more directly relevant to my work experience right now. do you think that you would recommend this course to anyone that you know? so far, yeah, i would. what kind of people would you recommend it to? who do you think would be a good target audience for this course? i actually think anybody that's interested in the subject, whether they're a student now, or just out in the work fields. it's a good introduction to chemistry to see if it's something you might want to pursue, or to help you understand current concepts. how likely do you think you are to take more chemistry courses after this course is over? when i started it, my thought would be that i would take an introductory, and then try to take a second chemistry course to see if that would help me some more. i'm not sure what that second chemistry course at this point should be. i'm still a little on the fence in terms of whether i might do another one or not.my thought was that this introductory course wasn't going to be enough for what my original goals were, and then i would definitely have to take something further, but i'm not sure what that would be at this point. have you taken other coursera courses in the past? no, this is my first one. how did you find out about this course? believe it or not, i heard a story on npr about, what do they call them, moocs? yeah. MOOC. that's the first i'd ever heard of it, and that's when i started looking up moocs. i ran into coursera, and that's how i got to this course. what is your general impression about moocs or coursera courses so far, after taking your first course? i'm generally positive. it's been a pretty good experience so far. what are some specific aspects that you enjoy about coursera? just being able to move at your own pace and own time is a big advantage. the tests seem to be pretty well-scored in terms of how they're interpreted. i've had good experience with that so far. the video lectures have all worked well for me. the online materials seem to be well done and are working fine for me, as well. do you have any difficulty with the math background, or do you think that you have strong enough of a math background to be able to go through the stuff in this course? the math has not been a problem for me. do you have a strong background in math? i think you mentioned that you have a degree in mathematics, so everything that's in the course has... yeah. my minor as an undergraduate was in mathematics. i took courses up through differential equations. again, it's been a very long time, but certainly algebra is something that i have a pretty good understanding of. what are your biggest complaints about both the specific course and coursera courses, in general? probably the biggest complaint, and i don't know how they would do it differently, is that, although you get immediate feedback on the quizzes on what you have right or wrong, you don't get immediate feedback on what the correct answer is.so far, i've been able to go back and figure out, if i have a wrong answer, how i got it wrong, but it would be nice to see the more immediate feedback. i don't know how you'd do that, and keep that information confidential from other students. how about coursera, moocs in general, what do you think the downside is to them? from my standpoint, i don't know that there's any particular downside. i guess for somebody who's actually working on a degree, it might be an issue in terms of how well they're seen by the academic community as a whole. how they would transfer to other universities or other programs, or how that might work.since that's not a concern of mine, i really haven't had to worry about that. this is purely just a learning experience for me. i'm not concerned about grades or anything like that. is there anything that you wish was implemented into the moocs or into the specific course that you feel like it's missing? no, other than what i've mentioned so far, in terms of the feedback on the quizzes and that sort of thing, not that i can think of. do you think you're likely to keep taking coursera courses after this one, maybe other courses that aren't chemistry? at some point, maybe. more likely when i retire, maybe. do you find this course to be very time-consuming? it's pretty time-consuming, but i don't think any more than any other college-level course would be time-consuming. i don't think it's more time-consuming than a regular course. it's not an insignificant amount of time. would you ever be interested in taking coursera courses just out of your pure interest, that don't necessarily apply to your work setting in any way? not sure. those are all the questions that i had for you today. do you think there's anything else that you would like to add to our conversation? no, not that i can think of. if you do think of any other questions, or any other comments at any point, please feel free to email me at dukecoursera gmail.com. your amazon gift card will arrive in your email within the next week. does that sound ok with you? that's perfectly fine, yeah. great. thank you for your feedback. you're welcome. thank you. have a good night. thank you. good-bye. good-bye.\tC16\tMale\tGraduate\t100000+\t55+\tUSA\tAmerica\tChem\n",
      "8\t...yes, the audio's very good. ok, good. great. the first thing that we're going to do is i'm just going to start by introducing myself and tell you a little bit about the research project that i'm working on. does that sound good? ok. ok. my name is , and i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of the research team for the introduction to chemistry course, and i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience. in the next 30 to 45 minutes, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and how you feel about coursera in general. you can tell me as much or as little as you'd like, and if you'd prefer not to answer any of the questions, then that's perfectly fine.your privacy is important to me, so after this interview is over, i will remove your name and email address from my notes. this way, nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity. your email address will be stored separate from my notes and be used to send you your amazon gift card. as soon as all the data have been collected and all the interview participants have been paid, all the identifying information will be destroyed.to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i would like to audio record our conversation. after my notes and the audio recordings from our conversation are transcribed, i will delete the recording.your participation, again, is completely voluntary. at any point, you may choose to stop the interview. your interview will not affect your class performance in any way. the instructor, dr. dorian canelas will not know whether or not your participated on the research.if you have any questions about this research, please feel free to ask at any point. if you have questions at a later time, please contact ducoursera gmail.com.lastly, i would just like to confirm that you are 18 years or older. is that true? yes, that's true. may i begin then? sounds good. the first thing i have for you is just tell me about yourself. you can choose to tell me whatever you feel is important and relevant. you can tell me about what kind of work you do, what you like to do in your spare time, about your neighborhood, just anything you feel is important, really. let's see. i am a vet tech educator and formerly was a business analyst. i went back to school to become a vet tech some years ago, and i now work as a vet tech educator for an online provider of ce. i have an mba. i have a master's in ed in distance learning.i'm taking the course pretty much just for my own interest. one of the subjects i teach is pharmacology. i had chemistry in college many, many years ago, so i'm just updating my skills in terms of basic, general chemistry. you mentioned that you took chemistry back in college. do you have a strong background in science and math, or just one of your earlier chemistry courses? my initial undergraduate degrees are in civil engineering, so i have a strong background in science and math but had only ever taken an intro to chemistry back in 1972. it's been a while. this is just for your pure, personal interstate, is that correct? pretty much. a little bit so i can explain things better to my students in terms of pharmacology and chemistry. it was so long ago that i took chemistry, so being able to update my skills... do you feel that it's effective so far, or is it difficult to tell? a few things have been useful so far. there was like, \"oh yeah, ok, that's how this works.\" things that i had forgotten. that was kind of neat. if this course wasn't available, is there another way that you could easily learn this material? i had been digging around. i had considered having a degree in distance learning. i like doing distance learning. i had considered taking chemistry at oregon state. they have an online class. when i found a free one through coursera, i'm like, \"that's even better.\" have you ever taken any other online learning courses? my entire master's degree was done online through northeastern. how do you think that the coursera experience compares with your previous experiences in online learning? more videos than i've had in the past. actually there's an awful lot of videos in the coursera compared to what we had in the program at northeastern. there were not so many video lectures. it would be one powerpoint lecture and then a lot of individual work. in terms of that, it's quite different. may i ask when you got that degree from northeastern? 2010. relatively recently, right? yeah. their model is a little bit different. i teach online for a few of my classes. i teach a medical terminology course online, and i taught pharmacology online for a different college. we don't do so much with the videos. it's more powerpoints and webinars. one school had live webinars, and the other, it's completely asynchronous learning but without the videos. do you think that maybe there are too many videos? i think there's an awful lot of videos. i would say too many. it's a daunting amount of videos to watch on a week. [laughs] they're pretty lengthy. do you think it would help if they were shorter, or do you think there should be fewer in general? if the amount is needed to present the work, they need to be in shorter chunks. i've done a couple of animal behavior, dog training type online courses, and the videos were in shorter chunks. it's a little less daunting if you're watching a 10-minutes video than a 25 or 30-minutes video. do feel like any of the information that you get from the videos are redundant? do you feel like there's a lot of repetition within the videos, or do you feel like everything that's being taught is necessary? there's a little bit of repetition, but for somebody coming to the subject brand new, it's probably not too much repetition. you have a good amount of background in science and math, so some of it might be a redundant to you. the math parts go really fast for me. it's like, \"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\" i really like the ones that were the demos. with dr. lely? yeah. he's great. it added a different flavor, at least the first two weeks. that's how far am. i got a little behind, so i'm still poking through week two. how many hours do you feel like per week you spend on the course? i'm probably spending four or five hours a week on it, which is a little more than i expected, which is how i've gotten behind. i didn't plan to have much... [laughs] do you work from home, then, and you watch the coursera videos whenever you have time, or do you watch them at a specific time every day? i usually watch in the evening. i teach at the college, but i also work for this online provider of ce. that's a full-time job working from home. they're located out in california, and i telecommute. i generally do the chemistry in the evenings. what other parts of the course do you participate in? there's the quizzes, the problem sets, writing assignments, and the discussion forums. which parts do you feel...? i've looked at the discussion forums. with so many students, it's gotten overwhelming. i thought, \"there must be a thousand people in the classes.\" with so many people saying, \"hi, i'm so-and-so, and i'm from here.\" oh my goodness! it's overwhelming.i've done the first two weeks of quizzes. i haven't looked at the problems sets yet. i do want to poke at those. it's not so much for the credit, just to see can i do them. i don't think we've gotten the writing assignment yet. maybe we have and i wasn't paying attention. [laughs] it might be posted, but i don't think it's due yet, so you're not behind or anything. do you think that's something that you would be interesting in doing, or do you think that's too much extra work outside of the quizzes and problem sets? i view it as too much extra work. with the writing assignment, how the grading works is that it's a peer review. if you write one, then you would grade someone else's, and yours would be graded by another student in the coursera course. is that something that's appealing to you, or daunting to you? it's neither here nor there. i've done some peer reviews in other classes. it's something i'm probably not going to do. [laughs] can you offer a little more on that? to figure out why you wouldn't want to participate in that. i'm doing this to refresh my information, so going off and researching and writing an essay is more work than i'm interested in doing. i might learn something interesting, but i'm just trying to remember some of my basic things. right, of course. and let's see. how important would you say the course is to you? that's a very vague question, you can choose to answer it in however way that you feel is appropriate. ok. for me, it's somewhat, it's not necessary for work. it's not \"oh my god, i absolutely have to know this stuff\", or i have this passion that i have to fulfill. it's been a thing the last few years with me, like gee, i want to do a chemistry course just so i can remember this stuff from four years ago, and bring it back up into the front part of my memory, when my students ask questions on not like \"i'll get back to you on that.\" so it has, i don't know, maybe medium importance if i was going to say low to high, it's in the middle. ok. and how did you find out about coursera and our course in general? googling around, looking for chemistry classes that were free. and i had heard about, who is it, mit? has a whole thing. an opencourseware thing. right, opencourseware. but a lot of the thing is, your left on your own. left on my own, i will keep up at all. i'll be like \"yeah, that was interesting, now off to the next thing\". whereas with this, at least it rolls out each week that it's building. it's not like here's an outline, and go through this material. on your own, right? it's building on the next. and have you had any interaction with the professors or any of the community aides? no. no? ok. let's see. because they are around on the discussion forums, but you think it would be appealing to you if they could, if you could interact with them in any other way? because one of the things that we're thinking about implementing are google hangouts. are you familiar with those? no. they're like a skype for google, but you open up a hangout, which is like a video session, and then i leave my camera on, and i'm in the hangout, and anyone who's interested can come into the hangout and just have a conversation with me and leave. up to 10 people, so it's kind of just like, imagine someone sitting in a room for office hours, right? oh, ok. would that be something that you would be interested in, or do you think that would just be too much hassle with scheduling? it would depend. if i was really stuck on something and wanted to ask a ta some questions, because there's some topic that i just wasn't getting, that's something i would possibly take advantage of. ok, great. let's see. have you had any other interactions with any of the other students in the class? no. no? are you taking the class with anyone that you know? no. no? ok. and would you be interested in forming that kind of community of peers, or is this more like an independent project? this is more of an independent thing with me. i probably wouldn't. because even in courses where it's been part of a degree program, i generally don't have a lot of patience for forming online relationships. right, and it's difficult. it certainly is difficult. how would you say that being in the coursera course compares with year in the classroom experiences? you mentioned that you have in classroom experiences as well as online learning? yes, i've done both. i think it's a little, of course it is duke university, but i think it's a little more material per week than i actually have had in real time brick and mortar classrooms. but i like, even if it's a dud, i like the details that she goes into, because she does explain things really well. other than that, i don't know, in a real-time classroom, you can ask questions. i don't fall asleep as much as i do in a real-time classroom. you don't fall asleep as much to the videos? less to the videos. sometimes in a real-time classroom, i will get bored and those off. and i've always been like that, even when i was a young student. i've been back to school a couple of different times, and i now teach one of the schools that i attended. and the running joke was \"barb would be in the middle there, she'd either be asleep or knitting, and sometimes taking notes.\" right. what do you think about the coursera videos makes it easier to pay attention? is it just because you're working on your own schedule so you're ready for it, or is it just being comfortable in your home environment? or is it just the proximity you have to your computer screen? i like that it's flexible, that i don't have to go anywhere, be some place at a particular time. i can fit around my schedule, i can work on the course while dinner is cooking. that sort of thing is very convenient. right, right. and how has this course generally affected how you feel about coursera or other online learning courses? i know that you've had experiences with them before, so it's not something entirely new to you, but has it changed how you feel about them at all, do you think? i would've liked more videos. i think at northeastern, just to connect a little bit more with the professors, not that i'll ever meet professor kanellis, but she comes into my kitchen a couple nights a week. she's very personable. yeah. i teach online myself, in a couple of different venues. and i've taken stuff, i'm continuing at being a vet tech online. i think this is very well put together. it's easy to find the materials. it's actually, i think, better put together than some others that i've seen. there is a nice consistency to the videos, her style is very consistent. as you watch them, you don't get a feeling of \"well, they threw this together over here in this together over there.\" right. you know, i think the coursera platform is also very consistent. right. have you taken any other coursera courses in the past, or is this your first? i haven't and i probably will now, because if they're like this. this is actually, i am surprised this is a free course because there's so much material in it. i've paid money for courses that have less substance. yeah. do you think that you would probably be more inclined into taking coursera courses for school or for work, or do you think they would be more for fun? because there's a whole range of courses that go from music appreciation to astronomy. i could see doing both. looking on coursera to see if there is a course that would help me on things at work, i was digging around. there weren't very many animal behavior ones, which i think would be a great course to have. and then there was some other stuff, it's like \"oh, i can take that for fun.\" right. and i guess the nice thing about coursera is that you're not paying, so you're not committed to it in that kind of direct way. yeah, if you get into it and you're like \"it wasn't what i thought\", you're not out a couple hundred bucks or a thousand bucks. exactly. coursera is a relatively new platform. what makes it different from all of the other online courses that are out there is just it's pure size, right? it's just a such a big class. a lot of people are concerned that coursera, and similarly, they're called massive online open courses, moocs, that they're going to replace brick and mortar schools. as an educator yourself, how do you feel about that? i think that's a commonly viewed threat. \"oh, my god, yeah, the online stuff...\"[] there, do i have you back? yeah, you do. [laughs] my machine did a little blippy thing. i don't know why. that's ok. it said, \"you're on hold.\" i'm like, \"what?\" i was babbling while we were probably on hold. [laughs] . that's a commonly expressed threat that online courses will take over from brick and mortar. i don't see that that will ever happen. there are some topics that are better learned in the classroom, particularly some of the laboratory courses where you really need hands on.if i'm training somebody in microbiology, i really want them to look at real samples, not beautifully presented slides, because the real world is messy, and not as accurate as what you might put up on a online thing. i think some classes lend themselves better to having a classroom community, or learning community, working together.sometimes you just want to learn something, you want like dragnet, \"just the facts, ma'am.\" you get online and you get it. i think the two are going to complement each other. i don't really thing the massively open online courses are going to take over. do you think that after having taken a coursera course, would you say that you have any specific criticisms about moocs, or coursera-style courses? if somebody came to me and said, \"i've taken this,\" i would actually be pretty impressed. whereas before i had gotten enrolled in this one, i would have been like, \"yeah, yeah.\" even though i teach online there's still a certain amount of, \"yeah, you took it online.\" [laughs] some of the stuff out there is pretty light. if the other coursera courses go in this depth, i think they're pretty impressive. this is a university-level course, not a less-than-community-college-level course. also, there's a lot of discussion about whether or not coursera should start offering college credit for these courses. what would you say about that? i would have no issue with this being a for-credit course because of its depth. the quizzes are not instantly easy. the video lectures are very comprehensive. i just would not view them as being not eligible for credit. where there is stuff i've taken, it's continuing ed, and you show up. [laughs] you don't have to put in a lot of effort.this you truly do have to get some work in, really pay attention, take notes. i could see these being offered for credit, absolutely. based off of what we've talked about in our interview so far, i would say that your least favorite part of the course is the length and the amount of videos. is that a fair statement? yeah. week two, there's 15 videos. it's like, \"really?\" i haven't added up all the little bits, but i'm not all the way done with week two, and week two is over. it looks like there's four or five hours of videos to watch, which is a lot. it could be stretched over a longer period of time. it's a lot of topics in any given week. it is, yeah. [laughs] chunked up into smaller chunks, and spread over 16 weeks, or something would be a little easier pace to keep up with. your favorite aspect of the class would be just its organization and the depth...? the depth and the consistency that...i now know what to expect, that each video she's going to really explain the slides, and tie in some examples. the depth and consistency is what i would say are my favorite parts. would you feel like there's anything else that we could add, any element that you've used in your past courses, or you've seen used, that is currently not implemented? i don't know. i don't think so, except for instead of discussion forums, some kind of a chat room. which would be hard for people all over the world to schedule, but a chat where people drop in and talk about topics. i know that you mentioned that the videos were long. do you ever feel discouraged? do you ever feel like just quitting the course? i do get a little discouraged. now that i'm a little behind, i'm like, \"oh, my god, i've got to watch all of week two and week three.\" i can see that i'm going to get to the point where i'm not keeping up with the quizzes. doesn't matter, because i'm not doing it for credit. it does get a little frustrating, because i do not like to be behind.[laughter] i know that previously you mentioned that you weren't really interested in forming a community, but do you think that if we implemented some structure to better form a study group, or something like that, do you think that would help, or do you think that would just add to the amount of stuff there is to do? it might be good. it's the sort of thing that would have to be there for me to try and say, \"yeah, this was useful,\" or \"no, it's not.\" there's so much in the course that i think adding anything more would be too much. [laughs] my suggestion would be stretch it over more weeks, just so there's not so much in any given week. that's pretty much all that i had to specifically ask you, but i could open the floor up to you. is there anything else that you'd like for me to know about yourself, about your experiences as a coursera student? i don't think so. i think we covered everything. just to reiterate, i'm really pleased. it's well organized. i like the sample quiz, so you knew what you were getting into before you had to actually do it. i like that there's a lot of online resources, as well as...i went and got the book. i figured i might as well have the book, and go through it, and read, and learn, because that goes along as well. was it easy to be able to obtain that book? wicked easy, i got it for $5.90 used on amazon. [laughs] do you think that book has been helpful to you? yeah, it's a pretty good text. i like it. it's not super dry for a subject that's really not... [laughs] it's chemistry. it's not all that exciting. the book is good. it's the kind that, instead of going, \"oh, my god, i can't stand reading this,\" i'm like, \"oh, that was interesting.\" i do think that he presents it in a pretty interesting way. thank you so much for your time. your feedback is really helpful. it's our first time running this course. we're planning to run it again in the fall, and maybe next spring as well. oh, good. the goal is to make it better every time, little by little. your feedback really helps, so thank you for that. good. you're welcome. your gift card will be emailed to your email address probably on friday, but definitely within the next week. does that sound all right with you? that sounds great. ok. that's it. have a good day. thank you, you too. thank you again. ok, bye-bye. bye.\tC17\tFemale\tGraduate\t100000+\t55+\tUSA\tAmerica\tChem\n",
      "9\t[laughs] now we can get started. the first question i have for you is pretty general. if you could just tell me about yourself, if you have a job, if you are in school, anything that you feel is relevant? ok. i have been out of school for a long time. i have a phd in english from ucla from 1975, so i'm a much older student than i would assume most of the students in the class are. chemistry was my worst subject in [laughs] high school, and my brother's got a phd in chemistry.i took a coursera course before. i took the course in caring for elders with alzheimer's and dementia because my mother had recently died after having been in a facility for years with alzheimer's.i really liked that course, so i got notice of the coursera courses. i looked and saw there were several courses i was interested in.for some reason, even though all my friends tell me i'm crazy, [laughs] i thought, \"i'll take introduction to chemistry because it's so not what i normally do.\" i'm a typical english major although i've been doing technical writing as a career for a long time.i'm used to being in technical areas, but i am not a technical person. i decided to take this course just because i wanted to learn chemistry, and that's it. ok. what you learn from this course wouldn't necessarily be applicable directly in any way to your work? no. ok. let's see. are you still writing as a career or are you currently retired or... i'm going to retire [laughs] in april, but i've been doing technical writing for maybe 20, 25 years. i taught at rutgers in the english department for about seven years.then i decided, because i knew i wasn't going to get tenure and i hadn't published enough, that i should look for a different career. technical writing looked like something i could do, and that's how i ended up doing it. you mentioned that you have a phd in english, so i'm guessing you haven't taken too many science and math courses. is that correct? that's [laughs] correct, yes. would you say this is one of your first chemistry courses or science courses in a while? oh, absolutely. yes. frankly it's very difficult. my brother's a chemist. he lives in washington state. i live in ohio, so i email him with [laughs] my chemistry questions.i have friends at work who help me, but the main problem i have with the course is...and i was prepared for it by the introductory materials that said you really need advanced high school algebra, which i don't have.i have to work really hard to answer even just the quiz problems. i started to do the advanced problems. that's when i realized i just don't have time. as it is the chemistry class takes a couple of hours every night for me at least. i'll be lucky if i pass to tell you [laughs] the truth. how many hours do you think per week would you say that you spend on this course? 15 to 20 hours a week, i think. wow, that's a lot. it is, yeah. and are those whenever you have the time or do you do them at a regular time every night? usually it's in the evening after dinner. i just go upstairs. i listen to the video lectures and then i do the quizzes. which take me a lot of time. sometimes i get stuck on how to calculate answers to the quizzes.and i spend much more time on that stuff and my limitations in math probably than i do on the course materials. i think in general the course is very accessible considering that it's a technical course. and i think it's really well designed. it's the math that's killing me. the math. yeah. so you mentioned that you watch the video lectures and you take the quizzes. do you participate in any other parts of the course, such as writing assignment or the discussion forums or anything like that? well, i just posted to the discussion forum because i had a question about the quiz in week three where i got the answer correct. it was marked correct, but when i looked back at it i thought, \"how did i get this answer?\"and when i tried to recalculate it, i did not get that answer. and i asked my brother finally and he agreed with me that i don't know how my initial answer was right. so this is an example of what i struggle with. so i looked at my answer and i think, \"that answer is not right.\"but it was marked correct so i have no idea why. so this is the stuff i spend time on. so i look at the forums and occasionally there are some interesting questions or comments. and i'm working on the writing assignment, which is very interesting.i thought, \"well, i'll write something about wine chemistry because i go to wine tastings and never really paid much attention to it.\"and it's really interesting. and i feel comfortable enough with the chemistry, the basic chemistry, to not avert my eyes like i used to. whenever i saw chemical equation i just, oh well, never mind, and i'd just skip it.so yes, i do. i mean, the fact that i'm working the problems and trying to do the quizzes and stuff for me is a big contribution. it's a big commitment to the course because it's really hard and time consuming. is your goal to earn a certificate in the course? it's interesting because initially i thought i'd just take the course and teach myself what i could and it wasn't important whether i got a certificate or whether i passed or not. but what i notice is i've always been a good girl student.and so i want to do well, even though it doesn't matter. i mean, theoretically it doesn't matter whether i do well or not. but it does matter to me. so i would like to pass the course.i know i won't pass with a distinction because i haven't been doing the advanced problem sets. but i forget what the other, when you sign up for credit. signature track, i think it's called. yeah. i don't care about that part. so it's more an aspect of your personality to want to finish what you've started? right. so going off of that, how important would you say that this course is to you? and that's a pretty vague question that you can choose to answer any way that you see fit. well, it's interesting because i think maybe, if we're speaking psychologically, that this is a way for me to focus my attention on something, that's intellectually challenging and not as difficult and tedious as trying to figure out what i'm going to do.when i retire or how to organize my papers or how much stuff to throw out or what to sell. so it's theoretically not important. and it's been very important to me.and i can't explain it to you because it's crazy. i mean, it's crazy to spend this much time and energy just for no reason, but it is important. have you interacted with any of the other students in the class? no, i haven't. i've looked at the forums, but i haven't. sometimes the questions that i have seem so basic that i hesitate to ask them.and other times i don't know why. because in the class i took on alzheimer's, there was a lot more participation of students talking about their own experiences and stuff.and i don't know why, to tell you the truth. i just have not found most of the conversations particularly engaging. and i've also felt like i don't have time.doing the problems and solving the problems in the quizzes and stuff and understanding the issues in the course takes so much time that i really have felt like i don't have time to do that. is the idea of forming that community with your peers something that's interesting to you? or it's just not something you're interested in? it's not that i'm not interested. but it's just not super important to me. it's more of a project for yourself that you're doing for yourself. yeah, that's right. are you taking this course with anyone that you personally know? no. ok. are there people around you that take coursera courses as well? no. i found out about the alzheimer's course. i was reading some stuff in the new york times and there was an article. and it was the first course that they had done. and it had a lot of rough edges. it was produced by the nursing department of john hopkins.so that's how i found out about coursera. and i have a friend who is very involved in higher education and knows a lot about mooc's and all this stuff.and i didn't even know what a mooc was. she said, \"oh, that's a mooc.\" i said, \"what's a mooc?\" so i'm new to it. and i liked that course.and when i saw the lists of things available i thought, \"this is such a great service to offer people the opportunity for really stimulating well designed courses for nothing.\" it's just magic, really.but i have told people about it and recommended it to other people, but none of my friends that i know of have taken a course. do you think that it takes a certain personality type to be drawn towards a coursera course and succeeding in it? probably. i mean, the thing that's interesting to me. when i initially thought about it, that it didn't matter whether i got a good grade or not and all that stuff.but the thing that's great for someone like me who is math challenged and chemistry challenged is it allows you to do it within limits. because there are obviously time limits. it allows you to do it at your own speed.and if you don't understand you can go back. and there are resources. i mean, you can go to the forums and you can ask people questions if you don't understand stuff.so for somebody like me, it's like if i were in a chemistry lecture course, i know what would happen. the stuff would go by and i'd have a question and i'd get stuck at something i didn't understand.and already the professor would be way ahead of me. and then i'd feel like i was lost and drowning and i'd just never make it. that's how it feels to me. that's what i remember about high school chemistry.so for me this class, and the coursera courses in general allow you to train yourself and go at your own pace. and i think the coursera courses are for people who want to explore. that's my experience, anyway. i mean, there are a lot of people who are doing it for credit, i guess.and i really don't know that much about that demographic of the course. but for me it's an opportunity to learn things at your own pace and have great resources available.and theoretically i don't have a lot at stake, although i notice that the amount of time i put into this course, i obviously think i have a lot at stake or else i wouldn't be doing this. when you approach this course and other coursera courses, are you expecting something that is like a direct translation of what you would get in a university classroom? or are you approaching it as something totally different? it's hard to answer that. because it's been a long time since i've been in a university classroom.i think this particular course is special in the sense that if i compare it to the johns hopkins course or if i compare it to the other course i'm taking which is in early renaissance italian architecture.i think professor canos is very engaging and charming and natural in front of the camera. and so in that sense it's sort of like being in a class with a really good teacher. so in that sense it is like a university class.but it's also..there's no community. or you have to create your own community. let's put it that way. and i guess that's true in university courses too. is it different? i think there's more freedom to it than there is in a university course. and that's one of the things i like about it. is there anything that you wish. i know you mentioned that you feel like the coursera course offers a lot of different resources for you to learn chemistry. is there anything you feel is missing or you wish was in place that currently isn't? well, this example. the example i gave you where i supplied an answer and it wasn't a multiple choice answer. it was a supply a number answer, like three significant figures answer to a particular problem.and when i went back i couldn't recreate how i got that even though it was marked correct. and i thought, \"how did i do that?\"then every time i did it i got an answer that was different from the answer that was marked correct. i spent a lot of time driving myself crazy with this.it would be nice to have access to a ta. i understand why they don't do that, but it would be nice to get answers to questions like you can go to the professor's office hour and ask your questions. i suppose the student forums are like that, but i felt uncomfortable doing that.i finally did post the question, but it was like, \"well, this is really talking about the quiz, which we shouldn't be talking about because the due date for the quiz is not over until 5 am tomorrow morning or something.\"i have people who can help me, but it would be nice to get questions answered. i know professor canelas has commented on how helpful other students are to each other. i could use that but for some reason have not felt comfortable doing that. what do you think would be the best mechanism to use if we were to implement something where you could talk directly to a ta? do you think it would be like a chat room, a direct messaging system, or even a video conference? i'm thinking about all the reasons why it would be really hard to do, [laughs] ok? i should just give you an answer and let you guys [laughs] worry about it.if you could have a live chat even if you could just say, \"i've got a question that i don't really want to post to the forums because it's a quiz question in this example, and it's maybe a privacy issue or something.\"i would be nice to send a question directly to the staff and have them answer it at some point if they could. sometimes the staff looks at the forums and answers the questions.it seems to me random when they do that, or i don't know when they do that or how they decide what they're going to answer. there might be some way to just say that you could schedule a 10-minute or 15-minute chat or something like that. that's definitely something that we're hoping to move towards because this is a comment that we get from a lot of the students where they feel like they get stuck on one issue.it takes them hours to get over it, whereas if it was in a classroom you could just raise your hand and be like, \"hey, i have a question.\" or you could catch the ta after class or you could schedule an appointment. i think that's it because i understand. i don't know how many students are enrolled. could you tell me how many students are enrolled in this? it's a couple thousand, but not everyone completes. they all complete different parts of it? yeah, i know because i think that alzheimer's course, there were even more. there were people from everywhere in the world, and i think there are in this chemistry class, too.i recognize logistics of that could be pretty difficult, but especially when you said that that's exactly how it was for me. i have spent so much energy trying to resolve this.either my answer shouldn't have been marked correct, and i don't know how i got that in the first place. now every time i do the answer i get the same answer, but it's not the answer that i was marked correct.i've been driving myself nuts. if i could just ask somebody, that would be really a relief. [laughs] right. definitely. a lot of people at that point give up on the course and say it's too hard.[laughs] yeah, i know. i don't want to do that, but i've got to tell you. we're on acid-based reactions and stuff. i know that i don't remember all the stuff about valence [laughs] electrons from week two. i've got to go back and review that stuff, so it's a full-time job for me to really learn this.when i get stuck on something like that and i get obsessive about it, if i could just let it go it would be nice. i'm [laughs] having a really hard time doing that. right. do you think after taking this course you're more or less likely to keep taking more science courses? i'd probably take [laughs] an algebra class. i don't know. yes, i think in the sense that traditionally if you were an english major you had science-phobia. if you were a girl english major, you never...we're talking generational now.i don't know if that's still true, although from what i hear there aren't very many female engineers anyway and female mathematicians or they aren't [inaudible 0:23:43] . what was the question again? [laughs] how likely do you think you are to continue taking science courses? i think i would. i might take some more general. there were courses in ecology and other things. some biology courses i might. i wouldn't do it as a steady diet because it's so time-consuming.but i would probably because i think this is a very good course and very well-designed. it encouraged me to consider that, and i wouldn't in the past probably have done that. do you think that you are more likely to take coursera courses just for pure interest or because it's going to be applicable to work in some way? no, it's going to be all interest stuff because i'm not going to be working anymore. i've been working for [laughs] a long time, so it's really just wherever my interest would lead me, what looks appealing, and what's a well-designed course?i think i might be more picky now about course delivery, the quality of the lectures, and that stuff. i think this course is very well done.when i compare it to the johns hopkins course, they were learning and it was obvious. they were not natural in front of the camera, and there was a lot of stuff that was glitchy.i might be more critical about the quality of the course delivery and stuff, but basically i think it's generous of people to do it and to offer it to so many people for free. i just think that's magical. i really [laughs] do. it's wonderful. those were all the questions that i had specifically for you. is there anything else that you would like to contribute to our conversation? let me think for a second. it's interesting to me. i don't know what it's like for people who are trying to get a degree.do you have a sense of how many people that's true for, that this is part of some degree program? or are most people pursuing it because they need it for work or something? do you have any sense of that at all? yeah. the coursera course as of now doesn't translate into any academic credit for any institution. it wouldn't be applicable in that way, but there are even just from the interviews that i've conducted a good amount of people.i would say about half and half. half would like it to prepare to go onto graduate school or something like that.there's the other half that's taking it out of pure interest like, \"hey, i've always wanted to learn some chemistry. this seems like a good way to do it.\" there is a very widely varying level of success. that's interesting. some people get fed up with it and say, \"chemistry [laughs] is not my topic. this is too hard and too time-consuming.\" i understand that. it's hard to give it up though. i think of that now. do i really have time to do this? is this too crazy?if i don't try to work the problems, it's like you just know you're not going to get even close to learning it because then you're just skating over the surface. it's really necessary in my mind anyway as part of my participation to really struggle with that stuff.as i said, i think it's a great contribution to people. i did not know. it seemed to me somebody commented in one of the forums or one of the comments. i think early on i read where the person was asking about professor canelas's participation in this.she said as i recall, now you can correct me if i'm miss-remembering. that she was doing this. she was not getting paid extra for this. this was something she was doing as a contribution.i'm not sure what the relationship between duke university and this course is.i know that she teaches at duke university, but i'm not sure i understand exactly how the universities participate or don't. is it different for different universities or is it all the same, or how does that work? do you know? yeah, i think that there is an initial contract between the university and coursera. i'm not really sure what that consists of, but the level of how much the university gets involved with the coursera courses varies a lot. i think duke really, really tries to get involved with it.they provide a lot of technical support. they're willing to provide incentives for the community ta's to be on the forums.dr. canelas herself, just in the conversations that i've had with her, just did it out of the goodness of her heart [laughs] i guess.she wanted to give out something to the wider world outside of just her classrooms where she's taught. this is her way of doing it, so yeah. i think your memory is [laughs] spot on. i think that's fabulous. that comes across, this generosity of spirit that she has in the way she teaches.i think that's part of what keeps me in the class because there's just this quality about her that really makes you want to hang in there. if you see her sometimes, then you can tell her i said that.[laughter] yeah, i see her many, many times a week. [laughs] she also has that same attitude where a lot of times she was filming a lot of these videos over winter vacation, and they're very time-consuming to just prepare for the whole course.she also hangs in there, so [laughs] i think it's mutual. yeah, good.clare: yeah, so those were all the questions that i had for you. if you have any questions about anything at a later time, you can always contact me at dukecoursera gmail.com. and your amazon gift card will be emailed to you within the next week. does that sound ok with you? yeah, it's fine. it's not really an incentive, but thank you. i appreciate.clare: yeah, ok. so thank you so much for your feedback. again, i'll to dr. knelles about what you said. and have a great rest of the afternoon, i guess. ok, thank you. you take care, clare. thanks.clare: thank you. bye. bye-bye.\tC18\tFemale\tGraduate\t100000+\t55+\tUSA\tAmerica\tChem\n",
      "10\tthe first question i have for you is pretty general. if you could just tell me about yourself? if you're currently working, what kind of work do you do? maybe your academic background? anything that you find is relevant. i graduated about two years ago from college with a bachelor's degree. i studied philosophy. i spent the last two years living at an orphanage in honduras, doing some service work here. it's volunteer work. it's a full-time job, but it's not a salaried position. yeah, that's been my overview. can you tell me about what made you enroll in this course? i'm interested in pursuing healthcare, so i think i'll have to go back to school to do that. a lot of different prerequisites i've seen for schools that i'm interested in require a certain amount of credits in chemistry, biology, anatomy, physiology. this is one of the resources i'm using to prepare myself to take those courses. this course is in preparation for other courses in the future. is that correct? yeah, that's right. yeah, that's fair. what is your background like in science and math? honestly, i last took a science course in high school. it's a while ago. in high school i took an ap chemistry, honors physics courses. it is long enough ago that i kind of forgot most of it. then math, i think the only math course i took in college was a statistics course one semester. it's pretty bare, bare bones. how many hours would you say you spend per week on this course? that's a good question. i watch all the videos. i don't know how. after that, i'm doing the quizzes and doing the advanced problem sets. the videos average what? five hours a week? something like... more or less, yeah. then on top of that, i put in an extra hour or two for time it takes me to do quizzes and problem sets, so maybe seven hours a week, something like that. that sounds a lot, something like that. when you were watching the video lectures, do you tend to just watch them straight through on the first try or do you find yourself stopping and re-watching a lot of the parts? i tend to watch it straight through. i don't know if i have the patience to try to understand everything in the moment. it's one of those things where you watch it, and then i feel like i do most of my learning when i'm struggling through the quizzes or whatever. i watch the videos straight through. when you're watching the videos, are you just watching them or are you taking notes while you're watching them? i don't take notes. i just watch them. they're pretty good. what's her name? dorian casales? canales, yeah. canales, yeah. she's pretty funny. it's good. do you think that if this course was not available to you in this format, would you seek out another way to learn the same material? yeah, i definitely would. i also use khan academy. there's a library here at the [inaudible 5:52] that had some stuff, some resources that i use for them. i'd seek something out. is this first coursera course that you've taken or have you taken previous ones? it's actually the second. i took a previous one. how did you get involved with taking coursera courses? it was recommended to me by someone i work with. they said that it would be useful to kind of like boost your resume. even though, that's not why i ended up getting involved. it was recommended from a college. just kind of going off of talking about resumes, is earning the statement of accomplishment at the end of the course, is that something that's important to you? it's not really important to me. i feel like i do it, because there is...i don't know. maybe it's how i feed my competitive side and i have my ego or whatever. no, it's very important for me. it's not equivalent to any college credit at the moment? no, no. i can't really see myself putting it on a resume or something like that. if anything, it's kind of an ego thing. have you used the discussion forums at all? a little bit. i used to at the beginning, to kind of like...i wanted to get involved but i feel like it's difficult to have. the last coursera course i took was a literature course. that's really easy to have a conversation with other people about and talk about different interpretation and stuff.if i'm struggling with a chemistry problem, i just feel like it's not...a forum doesn't strike me as the most helpful format to get it. i'll probably just google. you know what mean? google, \"how do you do this stoichiometry problem?\" something like that.i don't know. the forum, to me, doesn't seem like the most useful resource. when you do get stuck when you're going through your problems after the quizzes, just googling is your first way to go? yeah, it just seems more quicker? when you're taking a coursera course, like in a college setting, when you take a course, you kind of sometimes need to form a study group or form a community with people in your class. do you have that same attitude when you're approaching coursera courses? is it more of a project for yourself? it's certainly a project for myself. it'd be interesting if i could form a community with other students. i find that to be pretty difficult. i don't know for forums. maybe, forums would be a good idea, but no, i would just do it for myself. are you taking this course with anyone that you personally know? i am not. do find it challenging to motivate yourself through this course? not really, no. it's tied very closely into what i want to do later on. no, i don't find it hard to motivate myself. i don't know. dorian, dr. dorian, she's very engaging. i like her lecture style. i enjoy going back to the videos. obviously, learning online is different experience than learning in a brick-and-mortar classroom. how do you think the two compare? what do you think are the strengths and weaknesses? i feel like online learning is, i don't know. it's hard for me to say that it has any strengths compared to learning in a classroom. i think in pretty much every way, learning in a classroom is better, but learning online, i'm able to do it because i'm in this remote location and there are no resources. the fact that i can continue learning in my downtime is pretty awesome. i feel like i'm just very isolated where i live, and so that's the single advantage of online learning is that it's so flexible and so available. that's the cool thing about online learning, is that you can really get to students out there, do you know what i mean? you can educate people no matter where they are, and it's very flexible. do you think that where you are, given your location, is coursera something that people know about, or they use, or they would be interested in? i think most people would be interested in. i talked to some people about it, and so some other people have checked into coursera since i've been here. i think it's a great resource for people that are doing service work in developing countries or something like that. what was your attitude about chemistry when you were first going into the course? i was just very eager to learn. it's an intro course, and so i just really wanted to get my foot in the door with chemistry, and just start from the ground level. i guess very eager to begin, you know? you mentioned before that you had taken it in high school. was it something that you were good at when you took it the first time? no, absolutely not. i was really bad. i got like a one on the ap chemistry exam. it was something that i didn't take too seriously, and i don't know. i think maybe i didn't have a great experience in the classroom, so i certainly went into college thinking, \"ok, math and science isn't for me.\" now that i'm out of college, i'm eager to get into that field of study. all right. how do you feel about the difficulty level of a course? do you feel like it something less manageable to you, do you feel like it's too high, too low? to me it seems quite manageable. i don't feel like i'm over my head. it's quite manageable for me. do you think that a lot of the material, do you feel like it's repeated from stuff that you already knew, or does a lot of it feel new to you? i was going through the khan academy tutorials for chemistry before i did the course, and so in that way, with khan academy, there's not as much content. it's mainly just video, there is less exercises and stuff. i feel like khan academy, it kind of broke the ice and helped me understand. then doing this course helps me reinforce what i've already been introduced to, a lot of the time. i was familiar with quite a bit of it, but not very familiar. i was just shallow level familiar with a lot of it. if you could fix anything about the coursera course right now, if you could change any aspect of it, what would you change? i'm not a huge fan of the format of the advanced problem sets, i think. i don't know, there's a lot of, it's kind of repetitive, and there's a lot of \"change one thing about this problem.\" i understand the purpose of it is so that you're very careful about thinking it out, but i'm just not a big fan of that format of advanced problems. how likely do you think you are to continue taking coursera courses after this course? yeah, pretty likely. i think i'm having...i feel like it's meeting my needs pretty well. if i can continue taking courses in chemistry that continue to prepare me for when the plan is to go back to community college when i go back to the states. if i can take courses on coursera that prepare me for that. if there are courses available, i feel like i would probably take them. that would probably be the only reason i wouldn't, if my time didn't allow me, or if there weren't the courses available. i'd be very interested. how, do you think that you're more likely to take coursera courses for a functional purpose, like where you have to, you're taking it to prepare for going back to school versus how likely are you to take courses just out of pure interest? the last course i took was before christmas. it was in october, november, and it was fantasy and science fiction literature. it was purely something that i was just interested in, and i enjoyed. i would certainly, if i saw a course that really piqued my interest and seemed like a really good fit for me, i would be interested in investing the time to take the course. how important would you say that the courses to you? that's a pretty vague question that you can choose to answer however. i would probably answer saying, i have a lot of priorities. you can list your time, whatever priorities on your time. i think in terms of what i do with my free time, it's pretty high up there on the list. i make sure, if it's like sunday, and i haven't done what i need to do yet on the course, that determines my day. i have to schedule my day around getting the quizzed on or whatever. i'd say it's actually pretty important compared to the other stuff that i do in my free time. do you think that, when you take these, when you watched the lectures and do the quizzes and stuff, do you do them at a pretty regular time every day, or is it just whenever time allows? i guess it's whenever time allows. ideally i would do it, watch a video a day. but it's usually the weekend, oh my god, i need to watch all these videos. it's a pain to watch. what is your kind of general attitude towards this class? if someone was to ask you to kind of summarize in one word, or a very short phrase of how you feel about this class. i would say it's good prep. it's good prep for me. it's good preparation for something i want to do later. yeah, it's a good prep. that's my short phrase.[laughter] do you think that in general, reflecting on yourself as a student and i guess just kind of as a person, are you someone who likes to get stuff done, likes to finish stuff, gets competitive with yourself, kind of self-motivating?is that kind of how you describe yourself, or are you more of a laid back person that likes to explore different things? probably somewhere in the middle. i certainly feel this competitive urge to do the advanced problem sets, even though it's not that necessary. it's very less about, \"oh, i'm learning,\" and more like, \"oh, yes. i completed it.\"at the same time, i feel like my lack of involvement, in like the forum and stuff, is maybe an indication that i'm a little bit more laid back too. somewhere in the middle. would you classify yourself as someone who enjoys learning? yeah, certainly. i certainly do. i guess why i'm asking all of these kind of strange personality questions, is one of the questions that we are trying to answer, through these interviews, is, \"are these courses, are they getting at kind of the same population of students that already perform well in school, or is it kind of like an alternative mode of learning for students who don't succeed at traditional schools?\"that's why i'm asking all these bizarre [laughs] personality questions... really interesting. yeah, interesting. it's been nice so far. [laughs] oh, yeah. have you heard of any criticisms, of course there are courses, or they fall into a category of courses called moocs, which are massive online open courses, which feature platforms like coursera, there is also edx, if you've heard of them...? yes. ...and there's another similar ones? have you heard of any criticism of those kinds of courses so far? not this course specifically but just like those types of courses, right? right. no, i don't think so. i don't know, maybe it's just my experience but maybe there is some kind of like looking down on online college courses, they are like online education in general. i feel like people kind of generally look down at it. i think it's awesome, but i think that's an unfortunate thing. that's kind of i guess one of the criticisms. also, i guess another criticism is that there have been some movements to validate these courses for college credit or course credit. how would you feel about that? oh, yeah. i don't know. even if, let's say i could get the college credit...well, i guess it's more of a feeling than an answer, even if i could get discounted college credits for some of my pre-reqs, i feel like i would want to take the course again, in like a brick-and-mortar setting as you say, just to make sure that the quality is up to par, if that makes sense, you know what i mean?i don't want to get the credits for not actually knowing my stuff. maybe that's revealing that i don't trust online education as much as like...i don't know, maybe that sort of feeling is an answer in itself... yeah. i've nowhere to go with that. those are kind of all of the specific questions that i have for you. do you have any other questions for me about, of course the research, or any other comments that you'd like to add to our conversation? not too much, just to say hi to dr. dorian for me. yeah. [laughs] i will. i'll see her tomorrow at our lunch meeting. ok. just a random student said hi. i think she's really funny. keep up the humor on the web. she puts up like little jokes like the puns, and so that's it. [laughs] i think there are other things that kind of keep you engaged, because also that's one of the things that we are trying to do with our courses. to add different aspects of it, to make it a little more engaging, more fun. i feel like an online course is like online, and it's certainly dry. any chance you had to like just make it a little bit more human, is pretty cool. great. thank you for your time and your feedback. if you do come up with anything else at a later point in time, you can always reach me at dukecoursera gmail.com.your amazon gift card should be in your inbox tomorrow, but if for whatever reason it's not, then you can just shoot me an email, and we'll get that straightened out for you. cool, awesome. yeah. thank you again. [laughs] yeah, you're welcome. ok. have a good night i guess. [laughs] yeah, you too. bye. bye.\tC19\tMale\tBachelor\t<20000\t18-24\tHonduras\tAmerica\tChem\n",
      "11\tit's pretty general. if you could just tell me about yourself, if you are working, what kind of work you do. if you are in school, what are you studying? anything that you find is important. i am a fresh graduate of mechanical engineering, bs mechanical engineering. i have completed my degree in september 2013, and now i am searching a good job related to my study. actually, i want to learn more about chemistry and other science subjects, like physics. that's why i enrolled in that subject of duke university, but i am now mainly searching a good job. that's it. have you taken chemistry courses before this course? yes. chemistry is also a part of my engineering degree and [inaudible 01:16] chemistry is bit like thermodynamics and heat exchanging systems, et cetera. there are many relative courses. you can say the part of chemistry, which is other part of my engineering degree. before it, i studied it in my intern and secondary education as well. how many years of chemistry would you say that you've studied before? you can say minimum and more than seven to eight years because chemistry is a part of my studies since matric. you can say the secondary education, and the two years of matric, years of intern. then during my four years, you can say there are more than five to six subjects, which are related to the chemistry.the main, i told you about thermodynamics, heat exchange, heat and mass transfer. especially the separate subject, which has chemistry -- industrial chemistry is also a part of mechanical engineering. you can say more than seven to eight years i am related to the chemistry. what made you to decide to enroll in this course? because i told you that i want to be more familiar with the chemistry. you can say that i'd like to know about how to make the inner things or how the chemistry relates with our daily life. that's why i chose my subject. is it more for your personal interest or is it for your job, your work? no, it's my personal. because you can say that it's only the introduction of chemistry. i told you that i already read in my degree the thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer systems, statistical molecular theory, which are much more advanced than the introduction.it's only my personal interest in the subjects. that's why i took it from the internet. is a lot of the material that you're learning in the \"introduction to chemistry\" course stuff that you already know from before? yes. a lot of it is repeated? yes, because it's only related to it. before it you can say that i was much more familiar with some topics.like you can say that bonding and the other topics, i was not very familiar with before. but after doing the study from dr. dorian on this course i am much more familiar with it than before. how many hours per week do you think that you spend on this course? you can say more than five to six hours. five to six hours? yes. what parts of the course do you participate in? sorry? in the course there are the videos, there are the quizzes, and the problem sets. what parts of those do you do? the videos. just the videos? yes, my first preference is much more the videos then the quizzes because the videos are the most good part of that course. do you also take the quizzes, as well? yes, i completed all the quizzes at time. do you use the discussion forum at all? yes. what do you use it for? sorry? the discussion forum? where... yes, introduction. i used it only as a form of introduction first. secondly i only use two to three times of discussion forum. you can say one to two times for some typical problems. one topic, i remember that introduction of myself. two to three times, i used the discussion forum, not more than, you can say... do you read through the discussion forums often? sorry? can you please repeat it? yeah, do you read the discussions forums often? no, not too much. have you interacted with any of the other students in the class? no. while you are taking this course, are you interested in forming a study group, a community with your peers? is this more of learning on your own? it's more than learning on my own. if i face any difficulties during my this study or any other, i only google out, write the things on the google or search my books and then solve it.basically, i try in my level best to make a group, but you can say not from the good group members. that's why i decided to solve any problem with my own self. you tried forming a group before, but you found that it wasn't helpful? yes. was that through this course or was it through a different course? yes. through this course? have you taken coursera courses before? yes, one course before it, but you can say it's during my study, so i didn't give more time to that course. now, i have enrolled in more than five courses of coursera at one time. in all five courses, i have very good marks and very good...now, i am free from anything and i can spend more than time on my study and can settle. that's why.i am achieving a good marks, good result, and learning so much. how did you hear about coursera? sorry. can you repeat it? yeah, how did you learn about coursera? you can say, my teachers advised me to go to [inaudible 08:57] . you can say coursera, edx, and other online courses of stanford, harvard, to enhance my knowledge and take good grip on my subjects, so that's why i come on net and searched the courses and pick some courses on coursera.it's very much good than edx and other, because there are lots of courses on coursera than the edx and the other forms. that's why i'm... is there a difference between how chemistry is taught on coursera and how it is taught through your university? in my university, they are very much start basis, you can say from definition of chemistry and then from the history of periodic table, two to three sections.there are very long terms in my study, but in introduction of chemistry, there are only some basic things, you can say there are not much more details, there are only the basic which are used these days like equation solving, then chemical equation solving and the other part of the courses like ionic bonding, the chemical cells making, et cetera, et cetera.in that course, only the basics, but if we study in my university during my degree, there are lots of other things, from start, you can [inaudible 11:02] , but in that course, i learned only the basic use of chemistry, how can the reaction take place, et cetera, et cetera.that's why, i taught much more in that course. what are some of the other coursera courses that you are currently taking? now, i'm enrolled in five courses. number one course is introduction of chemistry from duke university, the calculus one from ohio state university, advanced chemistry from university of kentucky, introduction to thermodynamics -- transferring energy from here to there, and fifth is, how things work, university of virginia. now, i'm enrolled in five courses at one time.you can see that two courses is around about to finish and other three are continuing. are these courses to help you find work later? is it useful to you? yes, very much useful for me because all five courses are related to my field, just wait a second please.[background conversation] how do you think that you would take courses that are outside of your field or are you only interested in courses that are in your field? yeah, out of field is only the business courses because i like business very much. i want to learn most things which i have no much more knowledge, but because i love engineering, you can say like physics, chemistry, math, and computer, these four are my favorite subjects. i want to learn more things about all these four.after it, i like economics, accounting, because i want to do business in my personal life after two to three years. that's why, i want to learn much more about all the things, which are helpful in my future. these courses, are they available to you at your local university or any other courses not offered? i don't think so. all the courses are available on the net. i found much more courses. some courses, like the software-related courses, i don't found online on these university like autocad, pro engineer, solidworks, or online calculations.you can say, related to chemistry, i found a website, which is not free, that's why i found problem, but very much courses are on there. what are your favorite things about taking courses through coursera? two to three things, one, i thought that i can learn from the very much educated and very much good professor, number one thing is that. number two is these are courses free of cost, anyone who cannot afford the fee of the course, he can avail the facility.thirdly, these courses are very helpful to enhance the knowledge. you can say, we can see practically things, some experiments which are done by professor online in their labs, which we don't see before it. it's a very good thing. what are some things that you would like to change about coursera, if you could change anything, some things that you don't like? the time which we have to submit the quizzes or assignments are very low. you can say if we have one home work assignment or one quiz, we should have two to three weeks instead of one week or 10 days because this time is not enough for us, especially for a practical person who can learn during their job. is there anything else that you would like to change? no, the other things are very good. one more thing, there are very less amount of questions in home work. you can say if we have much home work questions, then we can learn more and after it, we can achieve much more marks in our quizzes.these are the two to three things. especially, third thing is because it's it, we should learn and get some software for calculations, online calculation, too. these two or three things are much needed to add to this course. do you think where you are, do people know about coursera? are they familiar with online learning? yes. there are lots of people who know about the coursera and the online courses, but there are very less quantity of people who wish to achieve this facility. but it's a very much common thing round about me. are they mostly people from your university or are they younger students, are they older adults? mostly are, you can say my elders -- not small or not big. you can say some my family member which are also graduates of university. there are achieving the course, not school or colleges guys. they are doing the study at that time, and they don't think so that they need to avail this facility. but after -- like me -- i found that i should enhance my knowledge in chemistry or other things that's why i did come on that platform and achieve some courses. that's very good for me. have you completed a coursera course yet, a full course before? no. not yet? i didn't complete. you can say i told you that. before it, i only enrolled in one course, but due to my study or due to my business, i didn't complete that course, but now, i have enrolled in five courses. in all five course, my result is very good, because i can spend much more time on my all courses, submit all homework, assignments, and the quizzes, and the other thing on time.i don't say that after start of my professional career, i can get that time. that's why i told you that quizzes and homework, assignments should have two to three weeks, not instead of one or week or 10 days. after you complete the course, you get a certificate, you get a statement of accomplishment. is that something that you want? yes, i want, because this is a part of the study and i work hard, very much hard on that course. i should get some certificate or a statement of accomplished. do you think that certificate will be useful to you in any way when you're trying to find a job? yes, i can, because it's an authentic thing. it's a registered certificate from a registered university of one of the good universities of world. i think that i... if you take it in someone's hiring you, who's giving you a job, would they think that's good? yes. that's very good. those were all the questions that i have for you. do you have any other questions for me? no, i don't. one last question i do have for you is how do you -- just very generally -- how do you feel about the course? do you feel positively about it? do you feel negatively about it? very much positive about, because i learn lot of things about from this course, because there are some weak points in chemistry of me like [inaudible 22:40] or the other bonding, the calculation, which after that course, i cleared very much. then now i seem very good about it. great. if you do come up with any other questions later, then you can always email me in ducoursera gmail.com. your amazon gift card will be emailed to you probably at friday, tomorrow, but if it's not, then again, please send me an email, and i'll figure that out for you.thank you for your time. thank you. thank you. bye. thank you too. last is, bye. bye.\tC2\tMale\tBachelor\t<20000\t18-24\tPakistan\tAsia\tChem\n",
      "12\t...i'll give you a chance to kind of ask any questions that you might have, and then we can get started with the interview. does that sound good with you? sure. great. so my name is , and i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of the research team for the introduction to chemistry course, and i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience. so in the next 30 or so minutes, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and how you feel about coursera in general. you can tell me as much or as little as you'd like, and if you prefer not to answer any of the questions, then that's totally fine. ok. of course, your privacy is important to me, so after this interview is over, your name and email address will be removed from my notes. that way, nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity. your email address will be stored separately and be used to email you your amazon gift card. after all the data has been collected and all the interview participants have been paid, all of that information will be destroyed as well.to make sure that i accurately understand what you tell me, i would like to audio record our conversation. after my notes and the audio recording are transcribed, i will delete that recording as well. finally, your participation is completely voluntary. at any point, you may choose to stop the interview. your interview will not affect your class performance in any way, and the instructor, dr. canelas, will not know whether or not you participated in this research.if you have questions about this research, please ask me at any point, and if you have questions at a later time, please feel free to email dukecoursera gmail.com. finally, i'd just like to confirm that you're 18 years or older. is that correct? yes. great. then we can get started. so the first question i have for you is pretty general. if you could just tell me about yourself, maybe what kind of work you do, what your academic background is, anything that you feel is kind of relevant to who you are. ok. well, let's see. i have a bachelor of science in psychology, but that was a while ago. that was over 10 years ago. i've kind of moved around a lot, so i don't really have a career. i'm more of a temp worker. right now, i'm doing data analysis. i work a lot with excel and sql and some other programs. that's about it right now. that's a good start. would you say that you have a strong background in science and math? i did. i definitely took a lot of math classes. i started out going with a biology degree so i did take some college-level chemistry, but that was a very long time ago. i did take up through calculus two and some discrete math, but it was so long ago and i don't really use it so i don't remember it. you mentioned that you took some chemistry in college. was that just one semester or a few? it was two semesters but i didn't do very well at the time. it was my first year if college and i was having some other issues. i did really well in high school but then, college-level, taking an eight a.m. class at a very selective, small, private college was a bit difficult for me. i did manage to take one semester of organic chemistry but, again, i hadn't done very well in g-chem so it was not so good. can you tell me about what made you decide to enroll in this course? i just wanted to see, i don't know, if i could learn something. if i had the actually energy to go through with the course. i just wanted to check it out for the first couple of weeks to see if it was something i was interested in getting back into because i've kind of considered going back and getting a hard science degree. that's about it. how has your progress in the course been so far? are you still continuing with the course? i haven't done it for the past couple of weeks. i did the first couple of weeks but i've been kind of busy with work and low energy the last couple of weeks so i haven't really been doing much with it. do you think that if this course wasn't available, would you seek out another way to learn this specific material? probably not right now, no. i have been taking some other courses at the same time. i have found myself a little bit more interested a marine mega fauna course right now that i'm been spending some time watching those lectures. unfortunately, chemistry isn't really at the top of my list right now. it's not directly, is it directly applicable to your work setting in any way? no, it's not. so it's out of just pure interest? yeah. exactly. while you were taking the course, how many hours would you say that you spent per week on the course? let's see, not too many. i was mostly just watching the lectures. probably two to three hours. did you also participate in the quizzes, the discussion forums, and the other aspects as well, or what it mostly just the lectures? it was just mostly the lectures. so you mentioned that you're taking some other coursera courses as well. so this course, i'm guessing is not your first coursera course? correct. how did you start getting involved with coursera? well, a friend of mine mentioned a course that she was interested in. it was a course on volcanoes because she had taken a class in college that was a geology class. it touched a lot on volcanoes. i had not heard of coursera. this was just last year. i was just really interested in checking out this free online college courses site. how many would you say that you've started since then? [laughs] probably about six, i would say. have you completed any of them? no, i haven't. is it important to you to earn a statement of accomplishment or is it just picking and choosing at the parts that you want to get out of it? i start out with the idea of completing it and getting the certificate of completion but i usually find myself, i don't know, just not having the energy after a couple of weeks. it turns out not to be that important. i find a lot of the lectures really interesting. i mean i don't really need any of these certificates right now but maybe in the future when i have a little more time. considering all of the different aspects of your life, how important would you say that these courses are to you? i'd say they're a little bit important but probably not that high right now. what do you think are the biggest things that cause you to stop going through with the courses? part of it is just, a lot of it is just work. [laughs] having other work that i need to do and just when i get home from work, i just don't feel like it. [laughs] i just feel very tired. it's just my energy level. it's really low. sometimes, when i have not too much to do at work, i will actually listen to the lectures at work when i'm doing something that doesn't require very much attention. it has to do with my work level too. would you say that time plays into this at all? well, it's not as much as you would think. i do have time in the evenings but i just don't have the energy. [laughs] would you say that the material do you find it that it becomes too challenging at all? a little bit. i guess too challenging in that i'm not really interested in putting forth the effort to actually study the way i would need to. because i did well at school when i actually did the studying, and actually put the effort in. right. so i guess what you're saying is that you have difficulty finding the motivation to continue with the courses? yeah. while you were watching the lecture videos, how did you feel about those videos? do you think that they were, were they engaging, where they informative? were they too long, were they too short? i think they weren't really too long or too short. i liked them because they were a little bit informal, and i thought they were engaging, yeah. i don't really know what else to say, because it has been a couple weeks since i watched the lectures. do you think, in general, when you take a coursera course, how interested are you in interacting with other students in the class? i guess right now i'm not that interested in doing much direct interaction. i mean, i do read the forum sometimes, and i have posted a couple times, but generally i'm not really interacting with the other students. when you're both reading through the forums and posting on the forums, what is your goal in being active on the forums? it's probably just to help me learn some of the material, as well as just to gain other people's perspectives on materials. it's kind of interesting to see where other people are coming from, their background. that's about it. have you participated, i know that our course has a few locations, and some other courses have google hangouts and things like that. oh, right. have you participated in any of those? no, i haven't. one class i was taking had a google hangout, but it was during the time that i was at work. so no, i haven't. do you know if you would be interested in taking part in such a thing, or would that just seem like too much to do? i would be a little bit interested. i know they do have limitations, meaning you generally have to, i don't know how many participants they allow for that kind of thing. i would be somewhat interested if it were a class that i found myself putting more effort into. are you taking this course, did you take the intro to chemistry course with anyone that you personally know? no. no? ok. how would you say that the coursera learning experience, both specifically to our chemistry course, and in general to all of the courses, compare with your past educational experiences? it's always a lot more casual. it's definitely completely self-motivated, as opposed to in the past. my previous education was something that i had to pay for. it was a physical class that i went to. but i like having the choice to put as much effort as i want into something, and not feel obligated to complete something if i find out that i'm not interested in it. yeah, that's about it. you mentioned that when you are in school, that you were a strong student. what were the things that motivated you while you were in school? actually, i had a lot of difficulty with motivation back then, as well. i guess i was always kind of a fast learner, so just going to class helped me a lot, and i didn't have to put as much time studying as maybe the average student. i just wanted to get a four year degree, so that was a motivation. how do you think the experience differs between going to a physical classroom and watching a video lecture online? it's a lot easier to be doing something else while you're watching a video is then when you go to class, so it's easier to be distracted watching a video. if you're going to class, it's going to necessarily be in that place, and there's something to be said for a place-dependent memory. if you do your studying in one section, or you go to class and you learn things in that classroom, it's easier to remember those things when you're in that place. whereas if you're online, you might be learning things in different places and move around. has this course affected how you feel about chemistry, the subject at all? it's made it seem like if i wanted to put more effort into it, it would be a bit more accessible. i'm interested to actually go back and catch up on some of the lectures, now that i've been thinking about it. otherwise, not too much. what was your attitude towards chemistry, the subject, when you are going into that class? into this class? yeah. it's just, there's something that i have a block with it, just because i had trouble with it in college. so, i have a little bit of a chip on my shoulder. i feel like it's something that is still difficult for me. did you find out a lot of information, were you familiar with it, or is it completely new to you again? well, the very first couple of lectures, it was familiar, but then i just realized that there's a lot of intro level stuff that i've forgotten. so yeah, a lot of it did seem sort of new. if you don't mind me asking, did you get your undergraduate degree at an american institution or a canadian institution? american. american, ok. i'm from the states originally. would you say that a lot of people in canada know about coursera? are they active on coursera? i don't think so. nobody i know is involved on it. my husband knows about it. i'm not sure about the general canadian population. i've been here for a few years, but the friend who introduced it to me is actually in the states. how likely are you to continue taking more coursera courses? very likely. i'm just going to keep going, and maybe one time i will finish one. [laughs] what are the most appealing aspects to you about coursera? right now, given my financial situation, the price is right. the accessibility. i like being able to just go online. being able to watch actual video lectures is very helpful to me, as opposed to trying to learn something on my own, where i might be doing my own research with no help at all. those are the main points. do you think that you're more likely to take them just out of pure interest, or for something that is related to your work? more likely for pure interest. i did kind of start some data analysis courses. i didn't get very far, but mostly because my laptop is kind of not working very well. i needed to install a program. i don't know. i kind of haven't been using a computer at home, just at work. do you think that when you go on coursera it's at a regular schedule every day, or is it just kind of whenever you have the free time? it's kind of whenever i have the free time. in your mind do you categorize coursera kind of how somebody would go through facebook, or a popular news site, or whatever they use to just mess around on the internet? or do you categorize it in your mind as something more educational do you think? i do think of it as more educational. i kind of do separate it in my mind from facebook or some silly news site. i don't know. i take it a little bit more seriously, even though i don't put the effort in. what do you think are your biggest criticisms of both the chemistry course specifically and coursera courses in general? i don't really have any right now. i don't know if it's because i haven't really finished a course. i don't really have any. i have taken a few quizzes in some other classes and there have been a couple of different formats for the way that they grade the quizzes and whether or not you can do multiple attempts. i think that's fine, whichever way that they do it.i have read...there was somebody who was complaining in one of the classes i was in, on the forum, about the method that they used for their quizzes. but i think it's fine because they usually have an explanation for why they do something one way or the other. i don't really have any criticisms right now. what do you think would motivate you to go through an entire course? what kinds of things? would it be if it translated into some sort of direct course credit? honestly, right now it would have to come from me and my life. i don't think anything on coursera would necessarily provide that motivation. it would have to be my own level of energy. great. those are all the questions that i had for you. do you have anything else that you'd like to add to our conversation? i don't think so. [laughs] i feel kind of bad that i haven't actually finished any courses. i don't know if that's... no, no, no. i've done so many of these interviews. there's really a wide spectrum. yeah, i guess i figured that. there are people just like you, who kind of dabble into different courses, and pick and choose what they want from it. there are other people who take it as a life and death matter, and must earn the highest certificate no matter what. it's really a wide spectrum. it's been really interesting to kind of understand and hear about the different perspectives from all those people. don't feel bad at all. your input has been very helpful. i think it's just coming from myself, because i used to be more competitive. i don't know, i feel kind of bad when i'm not putting that level of effort in. no, that's good to hear. it's kind of difficult to feel competitive with a bunch of people that are internet that you have no relation to. yeah, true. if you do have anything that comes up at a later time, i'm always available at dukecoursera gmail.com. your amazon gift card should be emailed to you within the next week, but if for whatever reason it's not in your inbox, please just feel free to shoot mean email and we'll get that straightened out for you. ok, cool. all right. yeah, that's it. thank you so much. have a good rest of the night. [laughs] is it night over there? it is, yeah. it's 10:30? yes. ok, thank you. you too. bye. bye.\tC20\tFemale\tBachelor\t35000-49999\t35-44\tCanada\tAmerica\tChem\n",
      "13\t...what we're going to do is, i'm just going to tell you a little bit about myself and the research that i'm doing, and then i'll give you a chance to ask any questions that you might have, and then we can get started with our interview. does that sound good with you? yeah, sounds good. great. so again, my name is , and i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of the research team for the introduction to chemistry course, and i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience. in the next 30 minutes, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and how you feel about coursera in general. you can tell me as much or as little as you would like, and if you don't want to answer any of the questions, then that's perfectly fine. ok. your privacy is important to me, so after this interview is over, i will remove your name and email address from my notes. that way, nobody who reads my research will have access to information on who you are.your email address will be stored separately to email you your amazon gift card. as soon as all the data has been collected and all the interview participants have been paid, all of that information will be destroyed as well.to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i would like to audio record our conversation. after my notes and the audio recording are transcribed, i will delete that recording as well.again, your participation is completely voluntary. at any point, you may choose to stop the interview. your interview will not affect your class performance in any way, and the instructor, doctor canelas, will not know whether or not you participated in this research.if you have questions about this, please ask me at any point, and if you have questions at a later time, you can always email me at dukecoursera gmail.com. finally, i would just like to confirm that you are over 18 years old. is that correct? yes. my year of birth is 1988, so well over 18. great. do you have any questions for me at this moment? no. then we can get started with our interview. the first question i have for you is if you could tell me about yourself. what kind of work you do, what is your academic background, anything that you find is important. my name is c3. i stay over here in mumbai, india. i have opted for this engineering course from computer science from university of mumbai. i have completed my engineering degree. after that, i'm very much interested in teaching. i teach people over here. i'm in education, i want to grow in that.i teach chemistry, i teach computers, it's quite a wide variety of subjects i take. i teach physics also, in general, but not to any university student, it's like a private class. ok. i still currently stay in mumbai, that is it. ok, what made you decide to enroll in this chemistry course? i actually got some popup on the internet that some free website is providing a course and something like that. i googled it, and then i found it interesting because i'm very much interested in algorithms and computer stuff, all that thing, languages and all.i also enrolled for chemistry just for my students, because they generally ask me many questions. i thought i'll be having deeper understanding. for that, i enrolled in the course in chemistry. great. do you think if this course was not available, would you try to find another way to learn this material? i don't think so, no. i have sufficient books around me, internet is there, maybe no. do you think that, where you are, there are other online learning courses like coursera that are available? no, only this website that i know in my area. how many hours per week do you spend on this course? initially, when i started, i started one week late. in one go, i actually went for four or five lectures together. i was keeping notes on that. it is very simple, so it was very easy for me.it was not overburdened or something like that, it was quite simple. have you had a lot of chemistry courses before this course? no. in india, the education system is, it is until tenth grade. after that, it's eleventh and twelfth grade. i am a science student, so until twelfth standard, i was having chemistry.after that, in engineering, just in the first year, you have one basic applied chemistry course, otherwise nothing. ok, what parts of the course do you participate in? there are the video lectures, the quizzes, the writing assignments, what parts do you participate in? training, i want to complete the assignments and all, but i couldn't do it, my schedule was a bit packed. i would watch many videos of it. i actually take part in quiz and everything. second part i think i will may do it later. do you participate in the discussion forum at all? no, not well aware of it. can you tell me why you don't? what keeps you away from the discussion forums? discussion forums, i haven't checked it out yet. i think maybe tomorrow, maybe in the future i'll do it. how do you think learning through coursera, how does that compare to learning in a classroom? in learning classroom, i think you can ask question immediately. over here i think you are having discussion forum that may help in that case. otherwise, it is very simple because the way of teaching in india, is it is very much different. it is all about like mugging up, and giving you the equations and they do not make you understand the concept behind it. coursera is actually very intuitive. it's very innovative and it's very simple to understand. yes, it is good. you feel that the coursera course has more...focuses more on understanding concepts. focuses...yeah. yes, exactly. how did you feel about chemistry when you were first going into the course? i wasn't thinking anything. for this course you are asking, right? before opting for this course? yeah. just i have started the lectures. first few lectures were actually...i find it quite boring because i was already aware of all the concepts and all, but still it was actually a very innovative way, she was explaining the lectures and everything.after that i got interest, so i sat there for three hours, three hours continuously i was watching lectures only. time is according to me only, in night whenever i get time, like 10 pm, 11 pm. i can watch it any time. that is the...yeah. what are your favorite aspects of this course? as such like that, it is like, first of all it is free. you don't have to pay anything. second thing it is actually very simple and the persons who are teaching, the teachers and faculty, they seem quite experienced. it is a good experience. what are some things that you don't like about the course? as such, there is nothing that i didn't like about the course. if you could, is there anything that you would fix about the course, if you could fix something. i think that thing actually may take some time. i need some time to think about it. as of now i don't think. i think it's perfect. have you taken coursera courses before this course? no, this chemistry was my first course. after that i went on for algorithm. then you are enrolled in algorithms next? yeah. is that also to help you prepare to teach your students? yes, it's quite a bit help. many examples i can give them. it's very easy for them to explain stuff. that's why. would you be more likely to take coursera courses for work or would you take it just for fun? for work, i think this thing may help me in the future but as of now it is just for understanding. i am just looking at the different perspective of explaining things, because i'm in teaching so i need to various ways, to explain to my students. some of the ways that i know, some of actually they are explaining. it's quite a help. do you think chemistry is taught very differently in india than it is in america? yeah, over there, i think that understanding is more important. over here in india understanding part nobody cares about. everyone is just like running up for getting some new colleges, like good colleges and everything. that is it. when you teach your students are you more likely to teach it in the american way or the indian way, do you think? the indian way, i actually have to, because for their parents, actually, their marks are more important. ultimately, actually, they want to see results only. they do not care much about understanding.but yes, actually, i do explain to them the concepts. actually they find they love my teaching a lot. have you taken a lot of science and math courses before, throughout your school? after school, i prefer just engineering and computers. yes, that is it. that is the only course that i have taken. let's see. can you tell me, how do you feel about the video lectures? i have told you, right? it's very simple to understand.it's the best thing, for me. it's very comfortable. anytime that you're free, actually, you can watch it. actually you can go through it again, so it's nice. is a lot of the material repeated for you, do you think, from courses that you've had in the past? i haven't gone for any such courses before, any online courses. yes, the material that i'm having with some reference book and everything, it's the same actually, but it's a much easier way to understand. when you watch the video lectures, do you tend to watch them straight through or do you stop a lot in-between? sometimes. not in the case of chemistry, because it's quite simple. but, yes, for other courses, like math, i have to go back. i have to pause it, or something like that. do you think at indian universities when chemistry is taught, is it taught in a similar way? is it just the professor talking and students taking notes? it's more like the professor talking. actually, i'm teaching students.they tell me the same thing. whenever they took college or school, actually they did not pay much attention in class because they said they do not get anything.the teacher is more about finishing up the levels. it is not more about making them understand, or something like that. do you think that you would recommend coursera to any of your students? i have already recommended it to them, to many of my students. but right now, apparently their exams are going on so they said that they would go though it later. do you think that a lot of people where you are know about coursera? no, actually. nobody knows about it over here. i actually talked in my friend-circle also, but no one is actually aware of it. do you think that people would be interested in coursera? yes, maybe, i think. i think if i talked to them, if i made them go towards the website at least once, i think then they would maybe be very interested in this.my students were very much interested when i told them about this coursera thing. they said they definitely will go through that. how important would you say that this course is to you? for me, actually, it was some supplementary material. it's some added facts that i can add to my teaching, like more examples that i can give, and more simplified ways that i can explain them.most of the examples, actually, that i take were mostly similar, or of that type only. but there are certain new things i am learning over here. have you interacted with any of the other students in the class? no. in discussion forum you're asking, right? in any way, yeah. through this coursera? no, no. not through that. is that something that you would be interested in? when you're taking a coursera course, are interested in forming a community with the other students in the class? again, the coursera students, right? the community? mm-hmm, yeah. i don't think i'll get that much time to participate in all that. but, yes, i can think about it later. are you taking this course with anyone that you know in-person? no. this is just a project for you, on your own, is that correct? yeah, actually someday i just came across it. maybe it was a newspaper over here in india that said a few websites are providing free courses. i just typed it in, and actually i find it quite interesting, so i started off with this course. what is your motivation? what makes you keep staying in the course? the main thing over here is, for me, in the daytime i'm actually busy with my software projects and everything. in the evening-time i teach students, so i actually get very little time.it is comfortable for me. at any time, whenever i get time, like in-between suppers i'm getting one hour or two hours free so i can actually go though this. when you're taking the course, is your goal to get a statement of accomplishment at the end? sorry, can you repeat that? when you're taking this course, at the end there is a statement of accomplishment, there's a certificate... some certificate? mm-hmm, yeah. no, no. that's not something that's interesting to you? no. i'm not actually interested. can you tell me more about that? why is that not important to you? getting a certificate? because i already have one engineering degree.this education thing, for me, is like another way of earning money. getting some more money over here, and helping me to utilize my time more. i do not need any of the certificates, because i cannot actually put it anywhere in my resume that i am good in chemistry or that my field is entirely different, it is computers. let's see. do you think there is a lot of online learning where you are? there are actually, but i've actually never tried to find it out. this one i just came across so, as i said, i just joined it.but in india, the culture is quire different. we do not go for more online education, but maybe it is growing right now. at the moment it's more classroom education than online education? yeah, but in the past one or one-and half years, online courses have grown a lot. [indecipherable 17:28] and everything, they provide them online. they provide many lectures. in what ways is online learning better than classroom learning? for me, the time factor, it is very much comfortable. whenever you're free, you can go through this. you need not be present at one particular time. it is quite easy also.i haven't gone through the discussion forms and all. i'll go through that, and i can maybe tell you later. yeah. those are all the questions that i have for you. do you have any more questions for me or any other comments that you would like to make about the course? no, nothing. that's all i have for you. if you do come up with anything at a later point in time, you can always email me at dukecoursera gmail.com. if you do go through the discussion forums and you want to let me know what you think about them, you can always email me for that. ok. your amazon gift card will be emailed to you probably this friday, but if it's not, then please shoot me an email, and i will figure that out for you. ok, fine, thank you. ok, great, thank you, bye.\tC3\tMale\tBachelor\t<20000\t25-34\tIndia\tAsia\tChem\n",
      "14\tmy research project, i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience. so in the next 30 minutes or so, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and how you feel about coursera in general. you can tell me as much or as little as you'd like, and if you don't want to answer any of the questions, then that's perfectly fine. sure, no problem. let's see. your privacy is important to me, so after this interview is over, i will remove your name and email address from my notes. that way, nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity. for me, that's not a problem. just to be safe. and your email address will be stored separately and be used to email you your amazon gift card. after all the data has been collected and all the participants have been paid, all of that information will be destroyed as well.to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i would like to audio record our conversation if that's ok with you. sure. that's no problem. of course, after my notes and the audio recording are transcribed, i will delete that recording as well. finally, your participation is completely voluntary. at any point, you may choose to stop the interview.your interview will not affect your class performance in any way, and the instructor, dr. dorian [inaudible 01:59] , will not know whether or not you participated in this research. if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me at any point.if you have questions at a later time, please contact [?] docoursera gmail.com. finally, i would just like to confirm that you are 18 years or older. is this correct? i'm 47, actually. ok, great. [laughs] i guess, if you don't have any questions at the moment, we can get started with our interview. the first question i have for you is pretty general.if you could just tell me about yourself, what kind of work you do, if you're currently working, what kind of academic background you have, anything that you find is relevant to our interview. it's a little complicated. basically, i'm a canadian. i live here in tianjin, china. i've lived abroad for nearly 15 years now in asia and europe. i started out as an esl teacher, and i wasn't happy with the results. i had been following a lot of what linguists had been writing and their theory, for lack of better word, was not relevant to reality from what i was seeing in the classroom and with students.i don't know why, i just opened the dictionary and looked up linguistics, and it was the study of language. it hit me there that the problem is that we've got people who study languages that think they know something about the brain and the mind.i decided to start from a new approach; i started to study about neurology. that was i guess about 12 years ago, and from there, i moved into psychology.for the last 12 years, i've been studying neurology and psychology. my idea is, since the mind does what the brain does, when you think about biology nature, then it's always a two-way street.the mind can be the brain. [?] i was suspicious that there were ways which the mind can be used to increase the rate of myelination in the brain, which is cognitive [inaudible 04:40] skills. i [inaudible 04:43] , i've been able to improve my students fluency in two weeks and also correct their pronunciation in under five minutes [inaudible 04:55].i'm continuing in this. right now, i'm helping a friend open a school because there are a lot of esl schools here that team up with middleman and send students to western universities.it's really an unfortunate situation because, first of all, there is no need for middlemen, second of all, they are charging fees [inaudible 05:26] . on top of that, from the university side, their problem is they're getting promises from china that a student, let's say for example, is at this level.when the student actually arrives in the west, a student is not the middleman or the school claims to be. basically, we've opened an esl school that focuses on sending students university students abroad. we're completely focused on quality. we don't advertise.we refuse to advertise, and our numbers are growing very quickly just by word of mouth. we believe that, word of mouth. if you cannot succeed through word of mouth, than you're not doing it right.secondly, students have to apply to be one of our students. just yesterday we had a group of three students who were kind of lazy. we've been trying to get them to study better and they haven't.all our students did some cet band-6 and band-8 testing. all these three students did well, so we gave the students back their money and asked them to go find a different school.we're building a system now that can really support what the western universities are looking for and help the students to be successful in going abroad because so many people are losing money over this. we want to try and stop that. how does chemistry fit into this whole picture? does it fit into that picture at all? it actually does because first of all, can i ask a little bit about your background, your education background? yeah, of course. are you studying in biology? i am, yeah. i am currently a senior here at duke, a fourth year. my first major is in biology and i have minors in chemistry and evolutionary anthropology, which is kind of like evolutionary biology. right, right. that's actually very cool. yeah, and i'm hoping to pursue medical school. that's good. chemistry is important to me because i'm interested in the brain.15 percent of the brain is neurons, where the other 85 percent are glial cells. the focus is always the neural doctrine. everybody always thinks about the neurons, but they seem to always forget about the glial cells.glial cells are the ones that build the myelin sheaths around the connections. all skills are essentially a memory, even in language. a language is a skill.for example, even just in pronunciation, it's motor but it's still neurons and it still requires myelination. that myelination increases the connectivity, the efficiency, of those connections.even right now i'm studying clinical neurology. it's also in coursera. it's university of california, san francisco.i just really want to deeply understand more about this myelination. also, i have my own little hypothesis that the conscious is from the neurons, and the unconscious is from the glial cells, so i need to learn more and more. as much as i can.plus, i find it fascinating. it's kind of a hobby, i guess you could say. chemistry is important in there. are you studying chemistry and neurology in a setting outside of coursera, as well? i do with edx. i only started moocs about two years ago, before that it was just book, book, book, book. lots of reading and studying.i have to tell you upfront, i don't know if this makes a difference to you. i dropped out of the course that we're talking about, the chemistry course from duke, in the first week.the reasons i dropped out were, one, the first week seemed a little bit, let's say, boring for me. edx had an excellent course. i believe that was either mit or harvard.it was an excellent course on neurology but, how can i say this, sometimes they tried to be too much like apple. some of the courses, they tried to be a different flavor, or they tried to be something new and exciting, and i'm, let's say i'm more traditional. i want to get down to business, i want to learn, and i don't need any flashy software. i don't need anything extra in my browser. what i need are my lectures and my reading material, and a discussion forum. right?and i need feedback on my tests. for example, like i said, i'm doing an introduction to clinical neurology, and i just did some quizzes, and this is the first time i've seen this in coursera. whereas they tell you your answer is wrong, but they won't tell you what the right answer is. that's not good in multiple-choice learning.in multiple-choice learning, you need to know the right answer in order to understand why you chose the wrong question. that is where you actually do your concept checking, is in the fact. but i understand, they're also doing extra accreditation for doctors who are continuing their studies, so i understand that they cannot post to the correct answers. but still, that's a little frustrating. yeah. so, what components of a typical course, have you taken a lot of coursera courses in the past, or is this one of your earlier ones? i've taken a lot. i've dropped out of more. i have a wife and two small children, and life here in china is not like back home, whereas sunday is a day off, right? so, one month you may be going full out, and the next month there's not a lot to do. so this often interferes with my courses. so i miss deadlines, and when i miss deadlines, i usually drop the course.also, i audit courses in the beginning because there might be seven or eight courses happening at the same time. i'm eclectic, i'm interested in everything. so, if i take these courses, in the first week, i have to decide which ones i canning cannot take. the most i have ever taken at one time were six courses at the same time. that's a lot, yeah. yeah, it was a heavy load, but i did it. so, what are the determining factors in what makes you stay in a course versus what makes you drop a course? i guess it would be, i was thinking about this yesterday, because i was thinking about what questions you might ask me, and that was what i thought you might. i had a lot of problems in grade school, and this was because i got easily bored.i always needed a challenge, and sometimes courses don't give me that challenge. i need to get into the material, i love to do a lot of extracurricular work. so for example, there's a module on topic x, and i will later go to the internet and look for as much information as i can find to get more, to get things told in a different way to really drive it home, know what i mean? right. so it's mostly, i guess, content that determines whether or not you will stay in the course? yeah, i would say it's content. like i said earlier, i like traditional lectures, assignments, tests, this sort of thing. i don't like, actually, one thing that coursera should do that edx does, i would suggest, was called a progress page. now, i've convinced a lot of people here in china to try coursera and do these courses. and they do them, but not one of them yet has achieved certificate.and i find it's because they don't understand the website. they're always missing things. just yesterday, i was talking to a friend, and she couldn't understand. she did everything, but when i looked at it, she didn't do any assignments. she thought they were all quizzes. so, this thing that edx has, when you do their courses, they have a progress bar and you can see if you're missing something. right. and the students that you mentioned that are unable to get the certificate because they're missing assignments, would you say that their level of english fluency is at a working proficiency, or is it, would you consider it limited? definitely. as an english teacher, i take this into careful consideration. and i have one student now, his english level is very low, but he's a neurosurgeon. and he's doing the duke medical neurology. i started that one, but i failed to read that you have to give 20 hours a week. and at the same time, i could not get the signature track.i spent more time trying to make signature track work than i did actually in the course. and so i missed my deadlines, and i'm still enrolled in it, and i still intend to study it, but i really want to do the signature track. what is appealing to you about the signature track? honestly? the aesthetics. look at the certificates. the coursera certificate doesn't even look like a certificate. compare that with the edx certificate. if you'd like, i could send you one. it's a pdf. sure. ok. so, would you like me to send you an edx pdf? yeah, if you wanted to do that just after the interview, that would be helpful. yeah. ok, great, great. i'll do that. i guess it's a feeling of accomplishment that you seek? the thing is, in the future, i plan to move back to canada. and i am sort of in the middle of a career change. i'm a technical writer, also still teaching on the side. like i said, helping my friend arrange and organize the school. i figure the more certificates i have in my portfolio or my cv, the more employable i'll be as a technical writer. right. do you think that, given your knowledge of the chinese educational system, are there equivalent platforms that are in place, both specifically across china, and in asia, as you say? let's put it this way. in china they're only starting to get this concept of night school. until a couple years ago it was when you finish university the only thing you could do was go back to university. there were no other options.china is all about rote learning so they focus on getting their students to remember answers rather than have the concepts which would be important in creating answers. the students that do try these coursera courses love them. they think they're great. they just can't understand the web page. what are some of the things they enjoy about the coursera course would you say? it's that they're not supposed to remember answers. they're supposed to have concepts. they know this. the students understand and are very clear in their own minds that they're not taught concepts so they don't understand what they're learning, but they can remember their answers.they do a test. they get a high score. but they all know if they were given that same test six months later they would score much, much, much lower. in fact, they'd fail. right, whereas the coursera courses i guess are kind of the opposite. you have different questions every time. yes. the nice thing about the coursera courses you have a lot of flexibility. there are people that will claim moocs are not nearly as good as going to university, but at the same time i think it can be argued in both ways.you have a lot of options. so, for example, while you're in a lecture hall just try to go to the internet to confirm what the lecturer said. meanwhile, while you're doing that you're missing what is further being said.i can pause my lecture and do some research on the internet to check into something that was said or shown. plus at the same time they'll argue, people will argue that, well, if you go to university you can talk directly to the professor.yes, this is true to an extent. the professor doesn't live in his office waiting to be talked to. he has other things to do, and he also goes home at night. where i have this discussion board, right? i can go back through all my lectures. i can find different ways to get my answers. i'm guessing just based off of what kind of conversation we're having that you are active on the discussion boards. is that correct? it depends on the course. in some i am, and in some i'm not. it really depends. some courses are sort of a breeze. if i have time i do go to the discussion board. when i get ahead of my studies i go to the discussion board and browse around and see what's up. every time i do this i find something interesting and get involved. when you are attracted to one of the discussion forums, what are you looking to get out of that? often i'd like to have my ideas challenged. one thing i've always thought that if i believe something. let's say i believe in x is x, 99 percent. then i can go to a discussion board and challenge people.let's say, time. a couple years ago it just occurred to me that there is no evidence or proof of time, and so what i did is i tried to prove time existed. i could not prove time actually exists so this is one of my ways of checking something i believe as i try to prove it's not true.sometimes i'll get others to do this. i'll get others to challenge my idea, and this is to help me confirm or support. you can learn a lot from a discussion boards. right, through other people. yes. it's like having the whole internet connected to your brain, in a sense [laughs] . do you think that while you're having these discussions with people do you feel like you are forming a community with them, an online learning community? i would have to say yes, especially for one course, but this course was a kind of special course in that it was aboriginal worldview and education, and, of course, when you're discussing aboriginal issues the main topic is always going to be the history, the present, the history, the present, and the future.it won't be so much about education. it won't be so much about worldview. it'll be about the inconsistencies and the unfairness and this sort of thing. so it becomes a kind of passionate type of discussion, and sometimes even emotional.i've noticed this myself that when people in a thread talk about one thing, if the thread goes for a while, if the thread is what i call successful, you'll find these people will always end up in other threads. it's kind of like a community in a sense. the same people are always talking to each other. i wouldn't say it's so much about talking to each other. for example, if there's a pretty in-depth and intense discussion about a certain issue, later if i go to another thread i might find those same people.there may be two or three thousand people involved in the discussion board at any time but i will find those people who...let's say we came to some...even if we disagreed at the beginning, but we came to a common understanding we tend to, i think, appreciate each other more.typically when i go into a discussion board one thing that attracts me is conflict, especially if it's aggressive, because i like to use diplomacy to make it work out. would you say that that's a personality trait of yours outside of the discussion boards? yes. i believe it is. i believe it is, because i've always been the kind of person that effort should always be put into peace. this is kind of a funny thing i say to myself, but the best way to have a complete victory over an enemy is to make him your friend. can you tell me more about your academic background in terms of degrees that you've acquired over the years or in the past? ok, let's start with grade school. i dropped out of school when i was 14. like i said, i was bored in school. the system was not very supportive. i was sent to a psychologist. the psychologist did a battery of tests on me, which i didn't understand at the time. i know about them now because i've studied psychologyit was decided that regular school was not enough for me. i needed to be advanced. so everybody asked me, \"ok, you're 14 years old. what do you want to do?\" well, i was into cars. i wanted to paint cars. so they sent me to a community college.the principal there, a very wise man, he was totally against it. he said that socially it would not work out. he thought i would fail. he didn't care how smart i was. in the end he said that the only way he'd allow me into school is if i scored above average on an aptitude test.i scored the highest score ever achieved on their test so he had no choice but to let me in. three months later, and exactly as he predicted, i dropped out. then when i was in my 20's i decided i wanted to...i've always loved studying. i've always loved learning. when i was in my 20s i decided, well, if i get my geds... yes. so my ged. then perhaps i could do something in university or college. i did my geds, and passed them no problem. i remember my lowest score was in math and that was 91 percent so i did well in there, too.i can't remember why, but things didn't work out. oh, yes, i remember now. i went to the community college. i wanted to be a machinist, because even since i was a kid i always thought cars were very inefficient. they could be better designed.i thought, if i become a machinist and then a welder after that i could start designing and producing a better car. i got accepted into community college for machining, but the problem was i was the only student so they dropped the course, end of the story.from there i decided i wanted to learn about science, and so i started buying \"scientific american\" and in the beginning i couldn't understand most of what was written in \"scientific american,\" but i just kept reading, reading it over and over and over until i could understand it.that proved to quite useful because a couple years ago in german i was working for the fraunhofer institute, and my job was to edit and help write peer reviews in science and engineering so that was good.all my study has been self-study. i've been self-studying for years. like i said, it's my hobby. i love it. i get a natural high from learning ,and the more i learn the more i want to learn. you mentioned you had difficulty staying in a brick and mortar school, a traditional school. what are some of the things about coursera that help you stay with coursera? it's my speed up to a certain extent. like i said, when i study something i like to do further research. when i was in grade 10, we were in world history at the time so we had a book, and every two weeks the teacher would introduce a chapter and then two weeks we worked on our own.our job was at the end of two weeks we had to reintroduce the chapter to the class, but we had to show we had the understanding of it so we had to talk about why something happened and the ramifications.when i did my first one i had spent hours in the library doing extra research.when i did this, the teacher was really amazed that i had done so much. he said that from now on it was my job to introduce the chapter. so i started doing that. i can see that this is the same with coursera.[inaudible 31:46] study material, and yes it's enough to pass of course, but passing, of course, is not enough for me. i want to get that deep understanding. the fact that it's online and you're flexible helps you get that deeper understanding? exactly. the discussion forms, you would say, also help facilitate that deeper understanding? in some cases. in this introduction to clinical neurology, in week one and week two, there were two modules each. the first module was on neuroanatomy. module two was on stroke. module three was on epilepsy and seizures. module four was on dementia.i'm a little bit [inaudible 32:20] with this course because i scored 9 out of 10 on 3 of them. on the stroke one, i scored 5 out of 10. i'm not really complaining about the 5 out of 10. i'm complaining about the ones i got wrong because you have a multiple choice.for example, it would be a question like, \"out of the four options, which is not relevant to this situation?\" they all look relevant, so i do extra research on the internet. i can't find any definitive answers anywhere. even when i review and review and review all of the course material, i cannot find a definitive answer.for example, one was about finding prions in the blood. that was the only option that seemed like i shouldn't choose that, that it's not effective in diagnosis. in fact, since 2011, they have been able to detect prions in blood in people with prion disease. [laughs] now the second opinion isn't helping. out of the courses you have taken in the past, what percent would you say are within your field of interest within neurology psychology? how many would you say are totally out of your field, but still something that you're interested in? what i'm not interested is a shorter list. i'm eclectic. i'm not interested in music. i am interested in everything else, pretty much. what i'm doing in neurology, and psychology, and linguistics -- this is not my only interest. i'm also interested in alternative energy. i am also interested in man of the humanities.medical is just something that i just can't seem to get enough of. [laughs] i'll just go to my coursera courses right now. that would be the easier way. i'm guessing that i'm not typical of the people you've been talking to. not typical? yeah. [laughs] not quite. [inaudible 35:18] list. basically, [inaudible 35:20] neurology, medical neuroscience, nutrition and health promotion for disease prevention, energy 101, planet earth, introductory organic chemistry part 1 and the same course part 2, useful genetics, intermediate algebra, pre-calculus 1, drug discovery, and development of commercialization.sustainability of food systems, [inaudible 35:50] life cycle [inaudible 35:51] , introduction to thermodynamics, diabetes [inaudible 35:54] teach online, introduction to consumer neuroscience and neuromarketing, the addicted brain, childbirth global perspective, the brain in space [inaudible 36:05], extending the brain in neurobiology, everyday life.[inaudible 36:10] upcoming courses, i've got applying to us universities. i've got to help my students learn. i've got human trafficking. i'm very interested in that one because that's an issue i think people should get involved in. there's [inaudible 36:31] kind of activists moving [inaudible 36:33] . [inaudible 36:34] literacy -- naturally, i'm very interested in that.for me, the biggest problem with coursera is, i'm interested in everything! law -- i taught common law in germany because they use civil law. in engineering, i worked with siemens engineers, teaching them about frmi technology and what the different manufacturers were doing.interestingly enough, each one has their own software, their own terminology and everything. strange. how many hours per week do you say you spend on coursera? according to my daughter, too much. she's five and a half. [laughs] some weeks, maybe 30 hours. it depends on my work, so it's really hard to come up with an average. i would say, if you look at over a year, 10 to 15 hours. there are some weeks where i may put in 50 hours.there's one thing i wanted to mention to you. i think a lot of coursera's students are people who have been in the workforce for years. a lot of the courses offered on coursera are very interesting, but they require let's say high school mathematics. not just high school mathematics, fresh high school mathematics.[laughs] i was really good in algebra, but i haven't seen it in years. it would be nice if coursera would offer some refresher courses specific to certain courses. what would happen is, there would be a lot more people joining coursera courses, taking [inaudible 38:54] .one thing that stopped me from taking a few courses was the requirements of basic mathematics. calculus, i can't even remember what calculus is. it's been decades since i've studied it. there just aren't very good options in terms of refresher courses at the moment? right. there are a lot of courses that i would love to take, but chemistry -- i need a refresher in chemistry. one of the reasons i didn't continue with duke's chemistry course is because there is this organic chemistry course coming out. it's an introduction. i have the basics. there are gaps for me. there's missing information. i'm not even sure where to get it or what it is exactly.i can't remember. was it duke university that had a course in physiology? i really loved the course and started it, but it got into the chemistry of some of the mechanisms of cells. i remember that was a big gap for me as i was missing some of the information on the chemistry of the cells. just from my experience in watching this course develop, a lot of these courses are direct translations of their university equivalents. that's what i thought. at least for the duke intro to chemistry course. there's literally a course at duke that is its exact counterpart, down to the week by week. of course, the work is a little bit different in terms of the testing and the assignments, but the content material is the same. [inaudible 40:54] . have you looked at the medical neurology? i haven't. medical neuroanatomy? no, i haven't. really awesome course with dr. white. you're looking at, like he says, at least 20 hours a week. like i said, i really [inaudible 41:11] the signature track with that. i couldn't get the software to work so i could actually purchase [inaudible 41:19] . [inaudible 41:20] it's an issue in china.when i was a child, i could never understand why we had to pay for education when the people are the number one resource in any country. why would we be paying for education? it only makes sense that education be free and encouraged in a country for future development.these moocs, they're the greatest things since sliced bread. definitely. those are all the questions that i had for you. do you have any questions for me or any comments that you'd like to make? sure. i've never seen a university course outside of mooc. since you're a university student and you're familiar with coursera's courses, i'd like to ask you a personal question, [inaudible 42:32] question. if we [inaudible 42:38] a university course, and we benchmark the difficulty at 10 [inaudible 42:44] ... i'm sorry. you're breaking up a little bit. can you repeat what you just said? if we made a bench mark, and the university course, if you're on campus, is difficulty level 10 -- 1 being no difficulty, like laying down and breathing -- where would you place the difficulty of the moocs from your experience? it really depends on the content of the course. it obviously has a lot to do with it. something like introduction to chemistry, its content is light. that's what i got. that's why i couldn't' keep interest in it. plus, i had to sacrifice some courses. even at duke, that introduction to chemistry course is very much so meant to be a gateway course into upper-level chemistry. it's intentional. probably, the university equivalent is going to be more challenging because of the actual work you have to do to get the grade that you want to get.also, the stress level is probably much higher at the university setting because you're getting numbers back, you're getting letters back. these will somewhat affect your future career performance, whatever. your course is sort of chosen for you. whereas in moocs, you can choose just 1 course or 10 courses. [laughs] moocs definitely are flexible. in terms of the video lectures, i know earlier you mentioned that you enjoyed that you could stop the videos. then watch them, stop them, and watch them again.duke is transitioning more and more to that kind of a system where there are the in-person lectures, but they're also often recorded. that's up to the discretion of the professor. if the professor is more of an old-fashioned, traditional professor, then they don't want that. they believe the student should be there in the classroom to learn.whereas some of the other professors are kind of catching onto this idea that you mentioned that if your classroom was 300 people, it might be better for you to be able to watch it 1... i can give you an example from my own teaching experience. i don't let students use dictionaries in my classroom. the reason for this is because i'm teaching oral english.when they don't understand a word, they stop. they focus on this word, and they spend their time on their dictionary. once they've gotten this word and they lift their head, they have no idea where the conversation is anymore. you lose this train of information. there's a huge break in it.if i were in a lecture hall, and the professor is talking and he says a point and that point really strikes me, i'm going to involuntarily focus on that point for a few seconds.at that point, i need to do something to it. it might be right at the very edge of understanding. if i can pause the video and double-check on something on the internet, that could be my \"aha\" moment. i mimic that in a live lecture. you do. something that you need to consider -- that's very dependent on your personality. i know a lot of students who are very, very ok with just absorbing everything the professor has to say like a sponge, and that's it. what i think would be the perfect situation is to be with a live lecture that's recorded. later, you can play back, view it again. everything we learn, we learn only because we associate it to something else.for example, let's say there's video lectures and reading material. they always say, \"read the reading material first.\" that's wrong. watch the lecture, get the gist of the idea. then, go back, read the material. you can associate it with the ideas, the thoughts that you got from the lecture.after you do the reading material, then go back and watch the lecture again. you'll find this is where you get your \"aha\" moments. then, you get some time to set in.but reading first. you know what cold is, even though you live in north carolina. you know what cold is, not because you've experienced cold, but because you know what warm is. if there was no temperature, if it was one temperature all the time, we wouldn't even have the word temperature.i've been teaching for almost 20 years now. there are some things you can get from teaching when you're really paying attention to your students. what's working? what isn't working?really, everything has to be through association. if it's not, it's called rote. rote is only good when you have to remember a lot of things. if you really want to get the concept, the gist of something, you have to have the association. [laughs] thank you so much for your time in this discussion. your feedback, your insight has all been very enlightening and helpful. if you at any point in time have other suggestions, other comments, other questions, you can always contact me at dukecoursera gmail.com.your amazon gift card should arrive in your inbox on friday. if it doesn't, again, please shoot me an email, and we'll get that straightened out for you. to be honest, i can take it or leave it. that doesn't really matter to me. [laughs] i do appreciate it anyway. thank you. if i can ever be a help [inaudible 49:40] survey, i'm more than willing.i'm very much a supporter of moocs. it's important moocs are successful now. i will not say they're successful yet. this is in the midst of an evolutionary change in education. once it's successful, it will always be successful, but it's still kind of on the testing board. there's also not very much research on mooc specifically. there is a lot on online learning, in general. our team, at least what we found in our literature search, is that there isn't very much formal research done, which is our motivation for conducting this study. we will definitely keep you posted with any further advances that we make. thank you. one more thing i'd like to suggest -- coursera has started these series courses. that's great. i love that. i hope there will be more. are you referring to the specializations? the three courses of those? yeah. [inaudible 51:09] five courses. there isn't anything yet. i almost took one in teaching, but i'm [inaudible 51:16] teaching. i'm changing over to writing. it would not serve me other than just being interested. it wouldn't serve me professionally in the future. i would like to see more of these specializations.i'll send you the edx course, the edx certificate, so you can see what it's like. i'm showing [inaudible 51:42] certificates here. i show students these because i want to encourage them to take moocs. when i show them coursera's, they're not interested. the aesthetics of the certificate does not at all [inaudible 51:59] certificate. i would say that needs to change. yeah, ok. ok? yeah, we will definitely take all of your feedback into consideration. thank you. did you say your name was ? yeah. [inaudible 52:15] yeah.

[inaudible 01:48] will not know whether or not you've participated in this research. ok. if you have any questions, please feel free to ask at any point. if you have questions at a later time, you can always email me at dukecoursera gmail.com. ok, cool. finally, the last thing is i would just like to confirm that you are 18 years or older. 18 years? no, it's 28. you're 18 years and older, right? who? you. no, i'm 28. right, so you're older than 18. yeah. you're asking i'm older than 18, ok. i thought you were asking to me i'm 18 years old. do you have any questions for me at this time? up to now, it's ok. great, then we can get started with our interview. yes. the first question i have for you is just for you to tell me about yourself, if you are working, what kind of work you do, if you are in school, what are you studying, what is your academic background, anything that you find is important? ok, my name is [inaudible 03:03] , as you see in my address. now, i am studying my phd, just starting my phd. i had background in physics, in material science, but during my masters and my [inaudible 03:22]; i had to know a good experience in chemistry.now, in my work, i need some basic chemistry concepts so i joined the course because of that. i'm studying my phd now, i started one month ago. originally, i'm from ethiopia. i came to[03:45] to study my phd. what is your phd in? nanotechnology. ok, great. would you say that you have a strong background in science and math or a weak background? i have a strong background in science and maths, not in chemistry. ok. before this course, how many chemistry courses have you taken? this is my first chemistry course. as i told you, i wanted it in my work now because it requires some chemistry concepts, my phd now. i'm attending it for that purpose, but i was in physics totally, most of the time. ok. do you think that if this coursera course was not available, would you try to find a different way to learn this material? yeah, i could try reading books and so on, but this is more organized. i can easily access information, additional information also from the discussion and so on. it is easier; it's more organized and easier to get the basics easily. how many hours per week do you think that you spend on this course? let me see, maybe four to five hours. four to five hours. what parts of the course do you participate in? actually, i'm using most of the times video lectures. for now, i don't need the certificate and so on because it is not related with my work, it is not a requirement.i only want to know the knowledge. most of the time, i attend the video lectures. when i have time, i see some quizzes, but i don't do everything seriously because, as i told you, i don't need the certificate for now. just the lectures, little bit of the quizzes, have you also done the problem sets, the writing assignment, or been on the discussion forums? no, i think i replied this thing in the first survey. it asks i think, \"why you take the course, how much you take, and so on.\"i mentioned there i wanted mostly to focus on the video lectures and to have the concepts. i'm not doing the assignments for now for this course. when you watch the video lectures, do you tend to watch them just straight through or do you find yourself stopping and replaying them a lot? usually, i follow them straightly, sometimes when i need to have the concept clearly or when i don't understand it in the first run, i just repeat it there and try to understand it again.sometimes, i repeat the whole video maybe the next day or so. do you feel that so far the course has done what you wanted to do? is it helpful to you so far? you mean this chemistry course? um-huh. yeah, it's very good for me. i didn't have a good background totally in chemistry, so even simple things are difficult for me.the professor clearly describes those simple concepts, the basics, and everything, it is very nice. i didn't have any expectation, what it looks like because if it were a physics course or something, i can get something, but chemistry, i'm just following it.i cannot compare it from my expectations since i did not have any expectation, but i'm getting very nice information, the basics, what i want and so on. great. have you taken coursera courses before? i took one course, basic nanotechnology by rice university. i took one edx course also, solar technology. i think i will start one course after two days or three days, nanotechnology and nanosciences in coursera. how did you get started with these online courses, how did you learn about them? when i was in ethiopia, i was looking for some lecture notes and so on. my friend told me about mit online course, edx. then, i started edx.then, i learned that there are maybe other online courses like that. when i asked colleagues and so on, one colleague informed me about coursera.i started to watch and to look for different subjects, which interest me and so on. what are your favorite things, what do you find most appealing about online learning? one good thing is when you are in a class, you can attend the lectures, but it is difficult to concentrate for one hour or two hours and to have all the concepts even if the lecturer is very good, but here in online courses, you can stop it and you can repeat things.even when i want to refer something, i just remember which video is it so i go there, open it, and i listen it again.i think it's very nice. you can access the information whenever you want, that's the best thing i have seen. what are some of your dislikes about online learning where you feel that, in comparison to classroom learning, it falls short? i'm thinking it is better, but when it is in a classroom, you will be more responsible since the teacher will be there and you may do the assignments properly because he might ask you to submit it in a deadline and so on.maybe here, sometimes you are lazy and you miss the assignment and so on, but in terms of transferring the knowledge, i think the online one is nice. as i told you, you can access it anytime, you can repeat it, and you can have all the concepts. for courses that you'll take in the future, do you think that you will take them in your field of knowledge, in science and technology, or would you also be willing to take courses that are completely different that you don't know anything about yet? yeah, i'm thinking. you know now, for example, i was thinking i don't have information about biology, and it is not necessary to my study now, but i was thinking to have some knowledge since i saw very nice biology courses.when i have time, i'm thinking also to take different courses to have just information about that course and some knowledge about that course.for now, since my work is loaded, i only take the courses which support me to my work, but i'm thinking to take [inaudible 12:50] have you interacted with any of the other students in the class? during this course, no. i come in the evening to my home. after that, i don't have much time, i just listen to the video lectures and do some other stuff.i didn't find time to interact and so on, but in the previous course, i have the certificates for two courses i mentioned to you earlier. i had to contact to discuss about the assignments and so on, but for this one, because of the time shortage and since the video lectures are good enough for me, i'm just following the video lectures. when you are watching the video lectures, you are working on some problems or something and you get stuck on the question, when you need help, what is the first thing that you do? shall i tell you from my previous experience because, as i told you, i'm not seriously doing these assignments for [inaudible 14:19] . sure. what i did is, first, i repeat the video lectures after seeing the problems to check i can get more information from the lectures, maybe in the first trial.then, the second, i post sometimes some questions in the discussion forum. i also first see some question posted by other students in the discussion forum and the answers. first, i search them and most of the time i get some similar question and answer for that. from the answer, i can easily understand my questions. i guess not so much for this course but in the previous courses that you have taken, where you did interact with other students, do you feel a sense of community with those students like you're all part of a group or do you still feel like it's your own individual learning experience? most of the time, i feel like i'm an individual learner, but when i see the discussions, answers, and so on, i feel like there is someone who is doing something with me also, so i feel sometimes a group member of that group. is that group feeling something that you want? what do you mean? when you're taking coursera, when you're taking an online course, is it important to feel like you're part of a group? yeah, i think this is important because you can compare yourself with them and you feel some students are also doing like you and you can get some help when you feel you are a member of the group. are you taking this course with anyone that you know in person? no, i just registered for myself. how do you feel about chemistry now that you've taken some chemistry? how did your attitude change from when you first went into the course and now about half way through? in high school, i know chemistry well. since i was a science student, i had to take some chemistry course. i have something about chemistry, but at this moment, since i was studying physics and [inaudible 17:30] physics and so on, i almost have no chemistry.now, i'm taking it since i need something like some chemical reactions and so on are a part of my phd work.i don't say this video creates me a feeling about chemistry. i think i already know about chemistry, i know it is a very good science, and i always feel, as a material scientist, it's a part of physics or something because even in physics, when you go to quantum level, we can get many things about chemistry.i already have something about chemistry, i already know about chemistry, so i cannot say this course only tells me some concept about chemistry. do you think that these online courses, could they ever replace the classrooms? it depends. when i was in ethiopia, i was really happy to get these online courses because in some courses you cannot have good lecturers and so on, but by this online course, you can have very nice lectures from very known professors.it is very nice for developing countries, but maybe here, you can easily find a professor in any university. i don't know, it might parallelly go, but in my country, it is very important.other problem is there is no access of internet. there is limited access, if the access problem is solved; i think for a country and a university like mine in my home country, maybe it can replace some courses.i think it might replace the lectures, but there should be also some guides there, at least to deliver the courses and to follow something. it can cover maybe half of the works i think. great, those are all the questions that i had for you. do you have any questions for me? you told me you are doing research on this online course, your research result is like to encourage, what's your objective? we have a couple of objectives. one of them is to improve the course. ok. we are going to offer this course again in the future, and since it is our first time offering this course, we want to know what are the good things, what are the bad things, how we can make it better. that's definitely one of the objectives.another one is just to understand the students better, where are you coming from, why are you taking this course, etc.i guess another objective is to see how students feel about online learning because a lot of what we know about, how people feel about online learning is from the point of view of the professor or someone that's giving the course.we don't know a whole lot about how students feel about online learning. i guess those are the three main objectives of our research. ok, thank you, i hope i gave you some information, which supports the research. yeah, thank you so much. if you do come up with anything else at any other point in time, you can always email me at dukecoursera gmail.com. your amazon gift card should be mailed to you shortly, but if it's not, please again email me, and we'll figure that out for you. ok, thank you. great, thank you. have a nice day. you too, bye.\tC5\tMale\tGraduate\t20000-34999\t25-34\tFinland\tEurope\tChem\n",
      "16\ti'm good. how are you today? i'm all right, thanks. it's pretty here in ireland today. that's great. so i guess the first thing that we're going to do is i'm just going to tell you a little bit about myself and the research project that i'm working on, and then i'll give you a chance to ask any questions that you might have, and then we can get started with our interview. does that sound good with you? that sounds great. great. i'm sorry, i have a little bit of a cold and i'd be coughing a little bit.inteviewee: it's all good. my name is , and i'm an undergraduate student here at duke university. i'm part of the research team for the introduction to chemistry course, and i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience.in the next 30 to 45 minutes, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and how you feel about coursera in general. you can tell me as much or as little as you'd like, and if you prefer not to answer some of the questions, then that's perfectly fine.your privacy is important to me, so after this interview is over, i will remove your name and email address from my notes. that way, nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity. your email address will be stored separately and be used to email you your $20 amazon gift card.and after all the data has been collected and all the participants have been paid, all of that information will be destroyed, as well. to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i would like to audio record our conversation. after my notes and the audio recording are transcribed, i will delete that recording, as well.your participation, again, is completely voluntary, and at any point, you may choose to stop the interview. your interview will not affect your class performance in any way, and the instructor, dr. knelles, will not know whether or not you participated in this research.if you have questions about this research, please feel free to ask at any point, and if you have questions at a later time, please email dukecoursera gmail.com. finally, i would just like to confirm that you are 18 years or older. is that correct? oh, yeah. then, i guess, we can get started if you don't have any questions for me at the moment. no, you laid that out pretty clearly. thank you. i guess the first question that i have for you is very general. if you could just tell me about yourself. if you're working, what kind of work you do, your academic background, anything that you find, that you find is relevant to this interview. actually, right now, i am retaking some high school level courses to apply for medical school. i'm hopefully starting medical school in september here in ireland.basically, the chem course on coursera is to supplement my own learning because as a mature student i am doing all my physics, my bio and my chem in independent studies, so i don't have much in the way of supports in that regard.the course has actually been really instrumental for me and really getting a grounding in chemistry. i'm a bit more of an auditory learner than just trying to dredge it all up in textbooks, so the lectures have been enormously helpful in that for me.it came along at the perfect time, the coursera course, for my own ambitions. yeah, it's where i'm at. i'm married. i live in ireland. my husband is an american. i'm 30 years old, if that helps with your demographics. what made you decide to go back and pursue medicine? that's a really long and complicated answer. the basic version is after having a chronic illness in my early 20's, i got married young and i never really got the opportunity to pursue higher education.medicine became a no-brainer because they're really isn't anyone in my immediate family or friend's groups who's lives haven't been touched by illness and haven't been hurt by poor doctors or bad applications of the medical system.i guess i always believed in the that whole be the change you want to see in the world. in the last, god, it's almost a year now. a year ago, this march, we lost my mother-in-law to cancer after she had suffered with ms for 10 years.in the august preceding, so less than eight months between them, we lost my father-in-law to cancer. a close friend of mine is undergoing gender transition is getting a run-around by the medical establishment.it's an area that's always interested me that i'm looking at and going well, you know what, if i can bring a little humanity to this in my little corner of the world, it would be a good thing to do. yeah, that's great. how does the medical system work in ireland? it's not the united states. you go through you're undergraduate and then you pursue medical school as a graduate school? actually, they have it undergrad here. it's five to six years depending on which program. so you apply usually with what they call the leaving certificate type school graduation exams, basically similar to the final exams in grade 12 or whatever. and then, you have to sit the hpat, the health professional admissions test -- which is saturday.which is more of an aptitude test, then anything else. it's gauging your ability to think critical thinking, apply yourself, human empathy - things like that.if you were going in straight out of high school, it's your academics. you get a certain number of points for each exam you sit. and then, you get your points on your hpat. and they total up your points and you get ranked according to those.going in as a mature student, they want you to have some sciences, which is why i'm going back and doing it, because i've been out of high school for a while. and then, they basically go, \"this is the minimum score you have to have gotten on the hpat before we'll even interview you.\"so, big exam on saturday. yeah. good luck. thank you. so this course, i guess, is mainly to help you prepare for that exam. is that correct? it's basically to help me prepare for the leaving cert exams that i'm taking. the hpat is, as i said, more of an aptitude test. so, to help prepare. yeah. but the other ones are basically finishing high school level sciences to just make sure that someone doesn't -- even as a mature student, you have enough of a basic recent grounding in the sciences that you're not going to get in completely over you head, just mostly, like everybody else, right?clra: apart from the studies you've done in order to prepare for the exam, how would you say that your background in sciences be just generally? not terrible. as i said, there's a lot around me who have been very sick for a very long time. so i've done a fair amount of reading, at least in medical science. a fair amount of horticulture because i'm a gardener. physics is hard. don't -- physics. i did physics in high school.i did the sciences up until high school level. the teen years -- 14 years ago -- i'm old. apart from coursera, what other resources have you been using to help you prepare for your exams? the textbooks, some youtube lectures and podcasts, reading over various revision guide. there was a experiments day put on by the university of maynooth over here -- nui maynooth -- if the detail helps.i think it's clearly designed for high schools who don't have the lab facilities or students in my boat who don't, get the opportunity to otherwise. but they host a series of days where they perform at least a portion of the mandatory experiments for the science exams.i had the opportunity to attend those. i guess basically all of the learning you've done has been self directed. it has. yeah. how many hours would you say that you spend per week on this course? about four hours, roughly. and what components of the course do you participate in? there's the video lectures, quizzes, the writing assignment, the discussion forums, which parts would you say that you're active in? i've been doing all the lectures and the quizzes. i did the writing assignment. i'm a little leery of the discussion forums, i have to say. i'm not sure why. actually, i know why because of the early days of the internet and message boards being a fairly ominous thing once upon a time.so message boards, i tend to just in general give a fairly wide grip on the internet. i will read them, and i occasionally read the forums, but i just don't really actively participate in those, i guess.i've done some of the additional problems, just to see if i can work a few things out in my head, but mostly it's the lectures, the quizzes. someone links to a textbook on one of them, and i've found the link for that, and i say \"let's download that\", which has been useful. that's about it, really. so, are you taking any other courseras along with this course at the moment? i am, i'm taking human physiology. and that's also helping you prepare for your exam? it is. at least, to give me a first, and to hopefully give me a little bit of a heads up for first year. do you think, have you taken coursera courses before these two courses? in a really half-assed sort of way, just flipping through. there is a european mysticism course that i'm technically signed up for that i check in on from time to time. my husband took a calculus course on coursera. that did him really well, he's going back to school too, to do engineering. and that was really helpful for him, for his math. so how do you guys...i'm sorry, go ahead. there's a buddhist meditation course starting at the end of march to the looking at, because god knows we all need more help learning how to deal with stress, right? how did you guys get started with coursera? i honestly don't remember. we've been clicking around it for ages now, looking for bits and pieces, watching a lecture here or a lecture there because i guess we're both nerds. stuff would come up from time to time that looks really interesting.it's been more than a year since we first found it, i think maybe someone linked to it on facebook or something. do you think that where you are, given your allocation, is coursera something that is known amongst the people there? it's known among a definite subset of my friends, and i linked my dad to it. another late student in our immediate group, he's doing forensic pathology and he's 60 years old.he has absolutely no time to look at these things anymore, but there's a certain notoriety among, we do fca, and there seems to be a real understanding of it in our subculture. and among our friends in the pacific northwest. in the middle of ireland, though? i don't know. is that better or worse? i've just moved my microphone. it's the same. i wasn't sure. rural ireland is, there's a lot of very contented people in rural ireland, and seeking out opportunities like coursera doesn't seem to be a real priority. some people i know know about it, but it's not really a thing. do you think that there are other opportunities in ireland similar to coursera? there's some e-college courses. foss, which has recently changed its name, which is one of the unemployment support groups, supports government agencies, has a few e-college courses that are available free of charge for the unemployed, which are pretty cool.in terms of adult learning, i think there are some opportunities. it's usually things like adult art classes and first aid and things like that, other than chemistry.i think dublin has a lot more. ireland is very much divided into, there's dublin, and then there's the rest. i suppose secondarily the other big cities, like galway and cork, but rural ireland is kind of...it's like time travel in a lot of ways.particularly coming from, i lived in canada for a number of years. as i said, my husband's american, so i spent time in the pacific northwest. and i'm surrounded by a lot of self-starting hippie types, coming back, moving to rural ireland is a bit of a culture shock, even though my family is irish.it's still very traditional, very conservative. i don't know if it's as much of a thing here, partly because of that. just because of the general attitude, i guess? i think so, yeah. have you interacted with any of the other students in the class? i haven't. as i said, i mostly avoid the forums. do you think that when you're approaching these coursera courses, are you looking to form any sort of community with your peers? as i guess someone would do in a classroom setting, or is this more of an experience, an individual experience for yourselves? right now, it's having to be an individual experience because i simply don't have time for the niceties of chit-chatting on the boards and stuff. i am currently unemployed, but i am basically working a full-time job to prepare for these exams for medical school. are you taking this course with anyone that you personally know? my husband was going to, but he's working. we'll periodically watch some of the lectures, but he hasn't been able to keep up with the quizzes and things. what was your attitude towards chemistry when you were first going in to the course? slightly intimidated. but that seems to be kind of a default state for me. excited but slightly intimidated, so it's better than being bored, right? if it has changed throughout the course, how was that changed? actually, i'm a lot more relaxed about it. i'm getting more out of it than i expected. it's not quite as, it doesn't feel quite as much like slamming my head into the desk is my physics work is feeling.i'm also actually going to register for the chemistry exam, that was one i was taking to supplement the physics and the biology learning for the medical school entry. because i have to get a 70 percent, a b and a c. i forget the exact, between them, to meet my requirements.i actually registered to take the chemistry exam because i've been getting so much out of the course. how do you feel about the video lectures? they're great. they're very helpful, the professor is very good at clarifying the points that need to be clarified. when you're watching through them, are you the kind of person that will just let it play straight through and you just absorb all of it, or do you find yourself stopping and rewatching parts of it? i rewatch parts of it, largely because i pull the lectures off the pdf slides, and take down a basic structure for some notes, and while i'm watching and i'm taking the notes. sometimes, i have to pause it for writing or to clarify a point, or just to make sure i've gotten the concept down correctly because... how would you say that you think coursera learning experiences compares with in-class learning experiences? i know that you mentioned it's been a while, but still, just kind of how you depend to. it's a fantastic tool for self directed learning, the coursera. the ability to work on it within the time frame, as in when you are in a better place for learning. i do better doing the lectures early in the morning, before my brain gets too tired. i can structure it however i want to. i think that's a great tool, because we all learn so differently. what do you think are the downsides, the negatives, to coursera? the negatives to coursera. honestly, having a bit more interaction would be great.my husband just popped his head around the corner and said accountability.it's both more flexible and less flexible, in that it is right out there and you work through it, then, that has some flexibility implied, and that you can do it when you are like that...you can't put up your hand and ask for clarification on a certain point.it does enable people like me to be reclusive about learning. human interaction can...other people in a classroom would sometimes ask questions you didn't realize you needed answers to yourself. do you feel like the discussion forums fill that role at all, or are they just too clattered too crazy? they might, but as i said, i'm not really the person to ask about the discussion forums. i haven't really spent too much time there. i did notice, when i did check in recently, that i'm not the only one who's had the issue with the \"down\" button on the quizzes. that's definitely one of the things that we are always working on, because we've recognized we've gotten feedback. numerous times, that one of the main downfalls is that students feel frustrated because they can't, like you said, raise their hand and ask a question on what they want to ask.for right now, one of the only mechanisms that we have, are those discussions forums. just the pure volume of people that post, the number of posts gets really overwhelming and disorganized. a lot of stuff can get lost that way. yeah. it's difficult for the professors or the community aids to filter through all of them. that is definitely something that we are aware of and working on. probably a pen in your neck as much as if it is anyone else. yeah, but it's so boring, you know? it is, absolutely. how likely are you, do you think, to take a coursera course? i know, currently you are taking them to prepare for your exams, but how likely do you think you are to take them for, i guess, fun? i am totally set on that buddhist mediation course system, right up my myalin, coming at a point of which i am likely to drive myself absolutely nuts. there is a few that i probably would have taken right now, if i wasn't concentrating so hard on the chem, the sitiology, and also my bio and physics.i was looking at the european mysticism one. that was one that i had on my watch list for ages, and it finally came up just at the point that i really needed the time to concentrate on other things. if that one reruns...i have a few on my little watch list of reruns.honestly, i'm finding it a great tool for supplemental learning. i might not go quite as all out. let's say i'm on this one and physiology again, unless there was something that i felt would support the learning that hopefully would be in my future.popping in and viewing lectures to clarify matters is then something i've been doing for a while, and will likely keep doing, until things come up. i know that there is a statement of accomplishment that you can earn. when you are going into these courses, is that a source of motivation for you? absolutely. to get the certi...sorry the... to get the cert, yeah. yeah. very much so. what is kind of your motivation behind that, because i know that at the moment they don't translate into the course calendar or anything like that? honestly, this stage for me, it's i can send this further on to for the support in medical school application. i am unemployed. i am a mature student, but it's the way of going, \"look. i am working on this. this is not some crazy notion i have pulled out of my hat. i am working towards this. i am serious about this.\"this might not be accredited, but it shows the effort that i am putting in. actually, last year when my husband was interviewed for his engineering program, he listed some of his cousera courses on his school application.a part of the interview, they were actually really fascinated to hear about coursera and what was going on. this is the trinity college in dublin. the s in the engineering department, they were intrigued to hear about it. that's an additional source of i guess something that you've done over the years? exactly. i think they might be gaining a bit of interest in that in certain areas in ireland, at least. at least within academia, i guess. mm-hmm. have you heard of any criticisms of cousera courses? not really. the people i've talked about it seem to be quite positive about it. i suppose the fact that it isn't widely accredited or whatever, can be a downside. on the whole, people seem to be pretty positive.one that i did hear that came up in a discussion with my husband the other day, was the fact that it struck us as odd a bit that the material, it seems at least on our side, to be, \"this is the material. we've got it all sorted out. it's all here. we're scheduling it as it comes up.\"why specifically are the time frames? say, you joined the class three weeks late. you are already screwed on three deadlines. the material is still there. if it were possible to...and it sees to be a coursera thing rather than a specific one.if there were some mechanism for the start date to be the start date, and for you to work through it that way, rather than it starts on january the 1st and it ends on march the 1st, period. it doesn't seem, at least on our end, for that to be much more difficult.if you find out about a course a few weeks in, and it's something that you'd really enjoy, it's certainly demotivational to go like, \"well, i can look in and pay attention and see if there is a few of the lectures that i'll find interesting. actually, the course unit, i've already missed the boat. that's certainly something that we are working to this course. this is our first time offering this course. we closed registration, i think around the third week. we've definitely got an email saying, \"hey, can i be allowed in? can i take the course?\" i'm not really... there's an advanced chem class running exactly the same time as you guys, but no later session is planned. i'm hoping to look forward through the material, but again i won't be able to get the certificates about one, but hopefully it will be a useful learning tool regardless.it would have been nice to have the startgates, obviously, not your preview, but yeah. i think, those were all of the questions that i have for you. do you have any other questions for me on just about anything, or any of other comments that you'd like to add to our conversation? none. i think we covered a lot. thank you so much for your feedback and your input. i wish you the best of luck on your exams. good luck with your research. if you do come up with anything at a later time, i'm always available via email. i'll drop you an email. your amazon gift card should be in your inbox this friday, but for whatever reason it's not, again, please feel free to shoot me an email and we'll get that straightened out for you. thanks a lot, have a good one. thank you, you too. bye. bye.\tC6\tFemale\tSome College\t<20000\t25-34\tIreland\tEurope\tChem\n",
      "17\t... going to tell you a little bit about myself and the research project that i'm working on. i'll give you a chance to ask any questions that you might have, then we can get started with our interview. does that sound good with you? yeah, that's fine. great. my name is . i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of the research team for the introduction to chemistry course. i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience.in the next 30 or so minutes, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and how you feel about coursera in general. you can tell me as much or as little as you'd like. if you don't want to answer any of the questions, that's fine. ok. your privacy is very important to me. after this interview is over, i will remove your name and email address from my notes. nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity. your email address will be stored separately and be used to email you your amazon gift card. as soon as all the data has been collected and all the interview participants have been paid, all of that information will be destroyed.to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i would like to audio record our conversation. after my notes and the audio recording are transcribed, i will delete that recording.your participation is completely voluntary. at any point, you may choose to stop the interview. your interview will not affect your class performance in any way, and the instructor, dr. dorian knelles, will not know whether or not you participated in this research.if you have questions about this research, please feel free to ask me at any point. if you have questions at a later time, please email me at dukecoursera gmail.com. finally, i'd just like to confirm that you're 18 years or older. yes. we can get started then. the first question i have for you is for you to tell me about yourself - if you're working, what kind of work you do, if you are in school, what kind of stuff you study, anything that you find is relevant. ok. i'm actually 42. i had my first degree in mathematics, graduated in 1994. i've been working for 20 years, mostly in administration. i'm doing budget and resource management administration, manpower and a lot of reports and planning, budgetary work. i work in the space industry, so i only work with engineers that do space [inaudible 03:05] . great. what is your background in chemistry specifically? i have none. my last chemistry course was in high school. that's 1988. what made you decide to enroll in this course? i was thinking of going back to university this coming fall and to take life sciences and technology. in that degree, it's like biochemistry. i want to brush up on my chemistry. do you feel that this course has done what you wanted it to do? yes, exactly what i wanted it to. great. do you think that if this course was not available on coursera, would you try to learn this material in a different way? nowadays there's a lot of learning online. like coursera, perhaps i could it with another type of online learning. or do you mean textbook? anything, really. yes. i would probably try to read as much as i could. how many hours per week do you think that you spend on this course? that is a good question. i would say more than 10 hours i would think. more than 10 hours per week. yeah. where in your schedule does that fit? is that usually after work at the same time every day, or is it just whenever you have time? it's usually on a monday. after the children are in bed, i can study for a few hours, and probably the same on tuesday. i reserve the weekend - maybe a saturday or a sunday - to complete the assignments or quizzes. what is your motivation for going back to the university to get your biochemistry degree? is it for a possible career change or just out of interest? i would like a career change. yes. ok. what components of the course do you participate in? there are the video lectures. there's the quizzes, the discussion forums, the writing assignment. which parts do you take part in? all. i watch the videos. i do the assignments. i do the quizzes. i do the advanced problems, i use the forums when i have a question or to read what other people's questions are. they help me as well. i would say all the resources - that would be information, the links. all of it. great. all of it. how important would you say this course is to you? at this moment, fairly important. it's takes up a lot of my free time. i find my free time is important time. right. i find it important. is your ultimate goal to get a statement of accomplishment in this course? no. it's not the end goal. no. ok. so the statement - that's not your motivation for this course? no. of course, it's always nice to have. i think my biggest point is to learn the material, because ultimately when i go to university, that will be the accreditation that i want. right. that's the degree that you're going for. right. yes. have you interacted with any of the other students in the class? no. other than the forum, and it was so general, they're not people to me. right. when you go on the forums, what is your motivation for going on the forums? in some cases, if i see someone that needs a little bit of cheering up, i would certainly help them. but mostly, it's to find answers to the reasons why i don't understand something. it's to complement the lectures. are you interested in forming a community with your peers at all? not necessarily. i wouldn't know what to say. are you taking this course with anyone that you personally know? no. no. how do you think that this coursera learning experience compares with your past educational experiences? i would say it is a positive experience. i have been in lectures that once you miss it, or if it's passed, there's no way to go back. we always have the opportunity to review a lecture. i find that a positive point.the only bad point is being in the environment of - so it's complete self-motivation, in discipline when you don't have people around you pushing you. if you have the discipline, i find it probably more positive than being in the classroom. right. do you think this course has changed how you feel about chemistry? i don't know how i felt before, so i don't. some of the people that i've spoken to before, either struggled with chemistry a lot during their university experience or during high school, so they went in with a nervous, bad attitude of it. i see. i had a very positive attitude about chemistry. i remembered liking it. did i remember anything about it? not really other than memorizing the periodic table. i would think now it's more daunting than ever because now you see all the things that you really don't understand and you see how much you still need to learn.chemistry is one of those things that you need to spend a lot of time understanding some basic principles before you can move any further. is this your first coursera course? it is. how did you find out about it? a russian colleague of mine mentioned it to me. do you think that a lot of people where you are know about this coursera platform? not the people that i'm around. they are all engineers and they're not taking these kinds of courses. what do you think are some aspects of a course that are missing? do you think that there are things that are missing from our course? i wouldn't know where to begin. i have no idea if anything's missing. for me, it's quite complete. do you think that, after this course is over, would you be interested in taking more coursera courses? i'm registered now for another one starting third of march. which course is that? i believe it's \"boot camp for biostatistics\" or something. are you more likely to take coursera courses for fun or for kind of school or work? it's a combination of fun and also the goal ultimately is to learn the material, to be competent. would you ever take this course...is the biostatistics course also to help you prepare to go back to school? this one's a little bit of curiosity because i heard about but i hadn't experienced it. it's a relatively new field, at least to me it's new. i don't think it was there when i was studied 20 years ago. i'm a bit curious of what they do, how they do it. i'll see. do you have any criticisms of the course, anything that you're unhappy with? i don't know how one could get around it, when you fill in the quizzes, i had, for instance, a space between the first word and then the parentheses with the number of charge on the naming of one molecular.i had it more or less correct except i had a space and then it was marked wrong. there's a lot of those sort of...the inflexibility of the quizzes, answering that is a poor point. i wouldn't know how to correct it. would you recommend coursera to anyone that you know? yes. what kind of people do you think that you would recommend it to? i would recommend it even to high school students or to anyone having difficulty in some of their studies to get a little bit more depth into their study. anyone who's interested in the topics. why not? you get more depth. what would you say is your favorite aspect of this course then? that i'm learning. the content, the material. as someone who is...have you spent any time either at an american university or living in america? i'm canadian so my university experience was in canada. do you find any of the course, any of the content, inaccessible to you because of its culture? does that make sense? yeah, i can imagine. the only thing would be the metric system, conversion to the imperial system. [laughs] i guess it's always common for people outside of america to have, but i grew up in a time when we still used imperial in canada. i have the knowledge of both, but i can see that that's a bit of a pain to do those conversions. apart from that, you feel that it's pretty much open for anyone from anywhere? i don't know from anywhere. for me it's fine. [laughs] those were all the questions i had for you specifically. do you have any questions for me or any other comments that you'd like to make about the course? i'm actually quite curious on how coursera gets its funding. how can they maintain these online courses? it's more through the university than through coursera. coursera facilitates it and provides a lot of the technical support. all of the content generation and the development of a course comes from different universities. they get funding. each professor makes a decision on their own. they say, \"yes, i want to make a coursera course,\" or, \"no, i don't want to make a coursera course.\" if you do want to make one, it's not so much that they give you funding for it. this course is almost a direct translation of the course that exists at duke university, so there's not much funding needed for that part.they do provide all of the technical support for filming the videos, for coding, all of the quizzes, all the lecture materials, maintaining the forums and stuff like that. that's from the university. ok. the professor doesn't earn any additional income because they're doing a coursera course - if that answers your question. i wanted to know if it's more philosophy or if it's [inaudible 18:45] . i don't know. i like it, but i question how it can be available. i think a lot of it is kind of philosophy. in my experience in talking to dr. conolas, her motivation was she wanted to provide something for the world - have that experience. it wasn't for a salary increase or anything like that. it is more philosophy. i don't have any real questions. ok. great. if you do come up with any other questions or comments, whenever, feel free to email me at ducoursera gmail.com. your amazon gift card should arrive in your email probably on friday. if it doesn't, please shoot me an email and let me know, and we'll get that straightened out as well. ok. yeah. thank you for taking the time to be interviewed. yeah. ok. good luck with your research. thank you. have a good day. you too. bye.\tC7\tFemale\tBachelor\t100000+\t35-44\tNetherlands\tEurope\tChem\n",

[laughs] it's ok. it will improve my chemistry skills. to help you with your master's degree? yeah, because i have to use the lab to produce ceramic materials. i needed to take a look in all the chemistry subjects again. you took chemistry, you studied for a year and a half during college, right? yeah, we have chemistry one, two, and organic chemistry. let's see. is this your first course in coursera? yes. the first thing that i was looking for was a chemistry online course, so i found this course. after two weeks, i started to take part in other classes from genetics chemistry at coursera, as well. are you still continuing with our course at the moment? yes. you're taking both the introduction to chemistry and the advanced chemistry? you're taking both of them together? yes. i'm a little bit crazy.[laughter] how many hours, per week, do you think that you spend on the course? i think that six hours. what parts of the course do you participate in? we have the video lectures, the quizzes, the writing assignment, and the discussion forums. what parts do you participate in? i always watch the video lectures. when i have time, i write something, the forums, but i don't have so much time. i wanted to read everything, from the forums, because they are very interesting. but i just write there when i have time. i think that i had... [laughs] one minute. i watch the videos, and i did every test from the course.i'm brazilian, so it has been a long time that i don't speak english. [laughs] that's ok. you're great. when you write on the discussion forums, what kind of stuff do you write? when i have some questions from the weekly quiz. before i write, i try to take five minutes reading if my question is there. then i write. nowadays, i wrote the evaluation from our peer assessment. for the writing assignment? yeah. when you ask questions on the discussion forums, about the quizzes or anything, do you feel that your questions are answered? we're not supposed to write the the answers, but they help me a lot. they help you a lot? yes. are the responses usually from other students, or are they from tas, or are they from the professor? both. sometimes, professor canelos writes something that helps me, and sometimes i can solve my questions, even with the comments from the other students. do you find that to be helpful while you're taking the course? yes, a lot. do you feel like you are forming a community with the other students? i don't know if it's because i don't have time to write every day. i feel comfortable with the people. i think that they help the others a lot. the only group that i take part in is for the spanish. i think it's called \"for latinos.\" it's very comfortable to talk with them. while speaking in spanish? yeah. do you also speak spanish fluently? i can handle to talk with someone, sometimes, but i'm not fluent. your primary language is portuguese then, right? yes. learning through coursera, how does that compare with learning in the classroom during college or during high school? the best things are that i study when i have time. i can stay at my home, lie in my bed, watching the videos, and taking notes. i think this is great. in fact, this was the first course that i took in the online form. they have things that are good, and things that are bad.for example, sometimes i think that i cannot express what i want to tell or to ask, writing. i need to practice this. it happens for this reason. what are some of your favorite parts about an online course? as i mentioned, it's related to the time that we will watch the video lectures. i don't know. sometimes, for example, when i had tests, i got nervous. but when i'm at home, and i'm doing the online test, i feel more comfortable because i can wear my pajamas and [laughs] solve everything. are you interested in earning the statement of accomplishment at the end? i didn't understand. can you repeat please? after you complete the course, you get a certificate. is that something that you want, or does that not matter to you? i want it. i really want it. yeah, it matters. [laughs] it's not because just to get the certificate, it's to have good grades, that i got new knowledge. i think that certificate comes as a consequence. are you currently on the signature track, or no? i wanted to take this, but i didn't have and visa international card. for me, it was difficult to pay for it. if this course were not free, would you still take it? i think so, but i don't know. as a student, i receive money from the government to take my master's degree. it depends on how much it will be. i like to buy books, to put my money in things that will improve my knowledge. how did you feel about chemistry before you started the course? i always loved chemistry, but in this course i felt that i solved little questions that were in the beginning of my chemistry learning. it made me like more of this subject. do you think that there is a difference in the way that chemistry is taught in brazil, versus how chemistry is taught in america? the only experience that i had with chemistry learning in america was with this course. it's not very different. some teachers here in brazil, they use experience or things that happen day-by-day. i saw that professor canelos uses this, as well. it's funny because i think it's the same thing. how much of the material in our chemistry course, in the coursera course, is repeated for you -- stuff that you've already learned in the past? one thing that i learned, during my high school, then again in college, and here in coursera, was a subject related to stochiometry. i don't know if it's because i had a whole semester doing those calculations. for me, i could watch the videos and it was very fast.how to name compounds was something that i had already learned. for example, the subject related to the solubility product, i had it in college, but at the time it was difficult for me to learn it. now, i learn it, for real. it was something that i saw in the past, but i didn't understand. some of the material, you already knew some of it, some of it you kind of knew. is there also stuff that you hadn't known before? there are some details related to naming a compound.[crosstalk] some of it is a little bit new? yeah. how likely do you think you are to keep taking more coursera courses? i made a list from the courses that i want to take at coursera. i saw nuclear science. for me, it's very good to take it, because i am studying in an institute only for this. and forensics, that's another one that i want to take. the part from chemistry, physics, or mathematics, coursera is very good. i like it. four or five courses, that will happen in the future that i definitely want to take. are you more likely to take courses that are for your master's program, like science, nuclear science, or would you also take courses that are completely different? i would like, for example, there was another course talking about the beatles. it was related to music and these kind of things, assistant ability. i don't have this time to take all of them, so i made a choice to just focus on chemistry. what was your attitude? how did you feel about learning? you said this is your first course that you're taking online, right? yeah. what kind of stuff? what was your expectation? what did you expect? i wasn't expecting that it would be so great, so i was telling my friend it was better than what i was thinking it would be, because i learn it more. for an example, i thought that i wouldn't take notes, for an example, and i have a notebook just for it. i write everything. i really learn it. that's the main point. do you think that you would recommend coursera to people that you know? sure. i already did. [laughs] three friends of mine are taking coursera courses, because i show it. they didn't know. they didn't know this website. i show it to them. do you think that people in brazil, where you are, do they know about coursera? do they do a lot of online learning? a lot of my friends, they study english through online, but speaking just for coursera, most of our friends didn't know this new way to learn. it's because just my friend don't know or it's the general idea of brazil related to coursera. if there was anything that you could change about the course, what would you change?[] i'm thinking.[] would you change anything about it? do you think it's good the way that it is? nothing came through my mind, because i really like the way it is. we can watch the videos online or we can download it, for example. this is great. the forums, i think they are great. i think that i wouldn't change anything. do you feel like the forums...do they feel, sometimes, like there are too many people on them? yeah, sometimes, difficult to follow a question or a specific forum, specific topic. it's because that there's a lot of students, right? yeah. when you're taking a coursera course, are you looking to make a group with people, like a study group? are you looking to just do this on your own? as i mentioned, it's because i don't have much free time, i don't usually look for...i don't know, to form a group. for example, i think there is a page that we can find a map, and it's marked where the students are from. i recognize people that were near from my city, my neighborhood. i think that if i had time, i would go -- i don't know -- to study with them, to talk about the course.sometimes, i got a little bit afraid. i don't know why. i don't know this person, so why...i get a little bit shy with a little fear to meet them outside the internet. let's see. those were all the questions that i had for you. do you have anything else that you would like to add to our conversation? i don't think so. i'm very glad with...i'm very satisfied with the lectures. i think i'm learning and...i don't know. i don't remember how to say this in english. it's like reading. we study something that we had already studied before, so it helped me a lot. to learn it, to hear it again. yeah. for me, it's great. like refresh your memory? yeah, that's the expression. great. thank you so much for your time and your feedback. if you have any comments or any questions later in time, you can always contact me at dukecoursera gmail.com. your amazon gift card should be in your inbox this friday. if it's not, then please send me an email and we'll figure that out for you. thank you very much. thank you. have a good rest of the day. for you too. bye-bye. bye.\tC8\tFemale\tGraduate\t<20000\t18-24\tBrazil\tAmerica\tChem\n",

yes. we can begin. sorry, that's just stuff that i have to say. the first question that i have for you is pretty general. could you just tell me about yourself -- what kind of work you do, what you like to do in your spare time, anything that you feel is relevant for the interview. i am a military wife. we are currently stationed in north carolina. i am a chemistry teacher. i have a chemistry major with a secondary science endorsement -- teach middle school and high school. i do teach chemistry and earth science here in north carolina. for fun, i grade. i play with my dog.my husband's currently deployed. we're taking this class together, and we're just doing it for fun. i obviously know all the content. that's what i figured. but it's fun to hear it again, and hear it form somebody different. being able to download the videos and use them while i teach is really helpful for the kids to see the different demos that she does, and the way that she explains it a little bit differently than i do. you use some of the videos to help teach your class? yes. you mentioned that you were a chemistry major, so i'm guessing that you have a pretty strong background in both science and math? yes. can i ask about your academic background, in term of what kind of degrees you have? i have a ba in chemistry from wartburg college, which is in waverly, iowa. i have an endorsement in secondary science, and an endorsement to teach all sciences. as far as math goes, i took up to calc iii, then that was all that i had to take, and stats. then i was done. i guess your decision to enroll in the course was to be able to do something with your husband, while he was deployed, is that why you... yeah, he enjoys chemistry. we both enjoy science. he wanted to refresh his knowledge of science before he goes back to school. i wanted to use it as an aid in my classroom, as well as to refresh some of my memory from general chemistry, as i teach it. what is your husband going back to school for, if you don't mind me asking? a biology degree. i know that you know all the course content, already, but if the course was not available, would you pursue another way of learning this material? probably not. would you ever consider paying for the course content or is free part a lot of it. the free part is lot of it, for both of us. so far, how many hours do you think you spend on the course, per week? probably not very much, to be honest. the tests are usually the most. i would say maybe five hours a week. are you on track with the course? are you on the fourth week? yes. what components of the course do you participate in? do you watch the lectures, do you do the quizzes, are you interested in the writing assignment? i do the lectures and the quizzes. how do you feel about the lectures? we've had some criticism that they're too long, and there are too many of them. no, not at all. they're really short, i would say. i think they're real short. some of the other videos that i've watched can be up to 40 minutes long. that's too long.she's actually really interesting to listen to. she's obviously very excited about chemistry. she's probably one the most entertaining people i've ever watched teach chemistry. she seems to really enjoy what she does. i don't think that they're too long, at all.one in the first week, when she had that other chemist talk about the demo that he was doing. dr. lyle? yeah, that one was too long. he was tripping over what he was saying. i noticed, in the other demos, when she had him do demos, she talked for him. i thought that was helpful. you said you take the quizzes. do you think they're too long, they're too short, they're too hard, they're too easy? they're the right amount of length. they are too specific. i don't know if anybody can change that, the way that you accept the answers for right or wrong. like i said, i obviously know the content, and i haven't got a perfect on any of them yet. i feel bad for people who don't know the content. a lot of that is the coursera software itself is not very flexible, but we have heard that a lot. are you ever on the discussion forums? i haven't. i was thinking about it last time, before i submitted my last attempt for the quiz, to see if anybody figured out how to type it in correctly. i knew the right answer. i just didn't know how to type it in right. no, i didn't. i know my husband goes on it to see how things are going, but, no, i haven't. are you interested in forming a community with your peers in the coursera course, or is it more of a project just for you and your husband? i would say it's just for me. i don't know all the rules of it, especially with some people getting the certification from this class. i would be too scared that talking to other people would help them cheat, especially if my profile says that i'm a chemistry major. i don't want to get stuck in that boat. you are taking this course with someone you personally know. do you feel like that helps you stay motivated to continue with the class, versus taking it alone? yeah. as a science department, where i work, we're all trying to take different classes that help us individually. all of us, being a small community of people that i already know, doing it together, makes it a lot better. our principal's really behind it, too. that helps. are all the people taking it through coursera, or are they taking it through different platforms? yeah, they're just taking different classes. do you know what some of those classes might be? one of them was a genetics class. i know my one friend is taking the dyno one, the 101 class. sounds pretty cool. have you had any other online learning experiences before coursera? yes. what kind have you had? i took an online spanish course, and i took an online math course. were those for credit? yeah, i paid for both of those when i was in high school, so i didn't have to take them in college. how would you say that they compare with what you've had in coursera so far? these are more interesting due to the videos and, like i said, her excitement. the other ones were a lot easier. because i'm not trying this for a grade, that doesn't bother me. i do think that the quizzes are rather difficult to enter in the right answers. it could be better if they were multiple choices. how would you say that your coursera learning experience compares with your past educational experiences, and like a brick and mortar school? she's definitely thought me some things that i did not know. i think that she is a good teacher. i think that i'm learning some things. i think that i'm learning new ways to teach the things that i do now. i enjoy it. has this course affected how you feel about chemistry at all? i mean i know that you already have a background in chemistry, so... i actually really like the way that she teaches. it makes it seem so much more exciting. a lot of people are very turned away from the chemistry subjects. yeah, i think that she makes me more excited about it. do you have anything specific that you might...? is it just her general attitude, or is it anything specific that she does? some things that...i never said she does it, i've tried to do in my classroom now, is when she ends all of her lectures, she always says like, \"this has been really fun to talk to you guys about this, and i hope that you've enjoyed it as much as i have.\"i really try to make sure that i come across my students. that's exciting for me. that's it. it's a subject that people can get really bored in. have you ever taken any coursera courses before specifically? no, this is my first one. how did you come across the coursera course? as a science department, we decided it's going to be a new thing. one of the other girls on the floor, told us about this one that was free. would you recommend coursera to people that you know? oh yeah, definitely. do you know who you would recommend it to? who do you think is good target population for corsair? i actually recommended my mom. she is pretty close to finishing out her degree. i just told her that it will be fun for her to do something that's, a, free and low maintenance, because she is a busy person too, and to just learn some things on the side that usually we don't learn about in actual college setting.like the dynoplasta genetics class, that's not something my mum would normally learn about. do you think that you'd be interested in taking more coursera courses in the future? yeah, i think i will. are you more likely to take them kind of for fun, like the dyno course that you talked about? are you more likely to take them to be useful in your work setting? i definitely want to take the advance chemistry class, to get me ready to teach an ap class course in chemistry. that would definitely better me as a teacher, and as a chemist. the fun ones would be good too. the genetics one definitely sounds interesting. both, i guess my answer is. have you heard about any criticisms of coursera courses? or kind of like coursera courses are in this category of things called moocs, which are MOOCs. they are relatively a new phenomenon that's sweeping the internet. have you heard of any of their criticism so far? no. i know as educators, this kind of thing, and like th khan academy and isaac's teach and all that stuff that's sweeping us right now, isn't doing nothing but helping us as educators. it's doing great things for us. one of the criticisms, i guess, the main criticism, is that people fear that this style of courses will replace traditional universities and traditional higher education. what would you say about that? absolutely not. people pay thousands of dollars to get the college feel, and living in a dorm room. personally, i went to a private college. i know what it means to be seating on money. no, definitely not.as long as people live, they are going to want to go at college and live in a dorm and go to the football games and stuff like that. they are not going to want to live on an online basis.the only reason why people would truly want to take an online course, or get an online degree, is if they are already having kids, or they are behind in money situations. anybody comes out of high school, ready to go to college, is going to want to go somewhere. no, this would never take it over.it might be like a big function of it, a big piece of it at some point, but it's never going to replace it 100 percent. i guess another criticism is kind of that there is not enough interaction, between both the professor and the student and the students themselves. do you feel like missing that hurts your experience or is it ok with you that it's kind of like you watching the videos, and walking yourself through it? i think that it would be more helpful if we could contact her in some sort of way. at the same time, i don't know how many people are in this class, i'm guessing it's a lot. if i did not go to a large university like duke, but if i didn't, i would never ever expected to talk to my professor one on one anyway. that part doesn't matter. another thing we are kind of thinking about implementing are google hangouts between the community tas and the students. are you familiar with google hangouts? yeah. do you think that would be something that you might be interested in, or does that seem like...? that's actually a good idea. that's a good idea. just to get your questions answered in a more direct way. is there anything else that you would like to tell me about? just in general, how you feel about the course. i think they've covered a lot of ground but... no, i think we really enjoy it. everybody that i know who's done it really enjoys it. i think that they are very... do you think that there is a certain personality type that is attracted to coursera courses or succeeds in them? yeah, you definitely have to be self-motivated. it would be really easy to get behind. also, you have to be the type of person who just loves to learn just to learn, which all educators are that way. if you are married to an educator, you are probably that way too.i love to learn all the time, that's why it's fun for me. if you had to do this for work, i could see how it could be really hard. there's also a new movement that's trying to put class credit behind these courses. do you think that's something that's valid, or do you think that's something that shouldn't be allowed? something that would really be missing out of this would be a lab credit. there is a million online simulations, but that never will replace in lab situation. if people do get credit for this course, then they should still be able to take some sort of lab, that is, face to face.if somebody could truly pass this class and do really well in these quizzes, which would be really hard, and do the writing assignments and stuff like that. if they really put forth to that work, then yeah, give them the chemistry credit, that's fine. i would think that they would have to do some sort of up face time in a lab. is the writing assignments something that you are interested in? is that something that you are willing to do, or do you think that's just too much work...? yeah, i was reading up on it. i know it's due in a week, i was reading up on it and seeing what it entailed. do you think there are any elements to the course right now that should be added that currently aren't there? anything that if you were teaching the course, you would put in place? i guess, i don't know too much about it because i'm not doing all the different portions of it. i think that if she has had like after lecture check ups...i know that every week we have a quiz.if she did smaller portions, or after the lecture you made sure that you understood what was going on there, and it was maybe like five questions, multiple choice. that way, even though there are a lot of lectures, you know that you are testing yourself, and that you understand before you go on to the next lecture. do you usually watch the lectures, kind of at the same time every day, or is it just one whenever you have time for it? i watch them at the same time every day. in the evening? yeah, when i get home from school. i think that's about it. we didn't go the full 30 minutes, but it's ok. do you go to duke? i do. i'm a student there. are you covered in ice right now? are you done? we are covered in ice. they cancelled the courses all day today, and probably tomorrow too. wow. don't die... got to stay alive, yeah. that's a big concern. i was worried that i wouldn't be able to do the interview because our... i know. our school was cancelled today too, and i honestly forgot about it until \"the regular show\" came on. i was like, \"oh my gosh. it's seven.\" i should check my ipad. right. yeah, i hope you guys are safe. i know that these north carolina people aren't used to this... not at all. no, it will get better. it's fine. sorry. just one more question. you mentioned that you teach middle and high schoolers, is that correct? i teach high schoolers... do you teach at a big high school or small high school? it's pretty big. i don't know how many kids we have there now. probably like 1,800. a couple hundred per grade. yeah. do you just show the videos directly to them and are they receptive to the videos? yeah, they think it's funny. i try to get them ready for college stuff, and they just think it's hilarious that people can stay in there or seat there and talk for that long, but i try to tell them that that's the way that life is going to be after high school. i actually did the flipped classroom, i don't know if you've heard about that? yeah. it's kind of a new phenomenon. they take notes and watch videos at home. the notes are what i write. i just write down notes for them and they take them at home. then, they either watch an isaacsteach video about the subject, or they watch one of her videos about the subject. then during class, they do you like group activities? yes, we do hands on activities, labs, discussions, problem sets, stuff like that. do you think the content is appropriate for their level? do you teach just like the first level of chemistry, or...? i teach honors chemistry. they are probably not all true honor students, i think a lot of them just barge through the videos. my kids, who are truly honors level students, they get something out of it definitely. do you think there is any sort of brand promotion, because the video is affiliated with duke. do you think they will be more interested in the university or...? yeah, especially here in north carolina. me and my husband are from iowa. people don't associate or affiliate themselves with specific university like they do here. if you say like duke or nc state, people are all about it. it could be like, \"we are going on a hog fire at...\" then people are like, \"yeah, let's go...\"i'm not used to that, but people really are like that around here. i think that they do enjoy it more that it says \"duke\" on it. thank you so much for your time and for your input. we are planning on offering this course again in the fall and again in the spring. every time we try to make it a little better. good. your feedback is very useful. your amazon gift card would be emailed to you most likely on friday, but if not, definitely the next week. does that sound all right with you? that's great. thank you so much, and i really appreciate it. if you have any questions about the interview or anything later in time, feel free to shoot us an email at dukecoursera gmai.com. awesome, thank you so much. thank you, have a good night. you too. bye, bye. bye.\tC9\tFemale\tBachelor\t35000-49999\t18-24\tUSA\tAmerica\tChem\n",
      "20\tplease tell me about yourself. if you could just tell me a little bit about yourself, what kind of work you do, what you like to do in your spare time, that would be great.as you know, my name is s1 and my complete name is s1 hossein. my family name is mandegar. i am a research scientist and my major research topic is regarding computer networks and from one year ago i started learning statistics and data analysis. i am really interested. by the way, my master thesis was about video stream processing.i started learning about statistics and especially about applied statistics, from my master thesis, and i am really interested in it. after i found coursera, i really like the site and i can say that one of the most interesting sites each week for me is coursera. i spend a lot of time each week on the coursera website.how has this course affected how you feel about coursera, or other coursera-style courses? how would you say this course has affected how you feel about the coursera courses, or other coursera   style courses?generally i like the coursera courses, and i always recommend this course to my friends and other members of my family. when i found coursera, i tried coursera courses. i chose many courses, but unfortunately i couldn't learn many of them.after that, i understand that i must choose a few important courses in coursera. one of the courses, one of my important courses was your course, this data analytics. maybe i said for the previous semester, if the course was [inaudible 05:02] , but there was some semester in the coursera.for my previous semester in coursera, i chose only two courses, one of them data analytics and the other one related to the data analytics and genes. because i am really interested in biology and gene data processing.how likely are you to take a coursera course for fun?what about taking coursera courses for fun? or are they mostly for work, or school?my priority is personal interest. i found effect of the coursera courses in my job, in my work        related to my course. especially this course, learning something about data modeling and understanding some technical terms of the statistical. like inference. many of the technical terms.i started to use some of them in my work. i know that i'm new in this field but i try. i'm trying to find more experience. i'm trying to improve my experience in statistics.what is your academic background?can you tell me a little bit more about your academic background? yes, for sure. i graduated in bachelor regarding to computer hardware engineering. my master was in information technology, regarding to the computer networks.when i was in bachelor of science i was researching on robotics and robotic   related subjects. my master, i changed my research to the networks and some data analytics regarding to the stream processing and network data streams.\t\tif this course was not available, is there another way you could learn this material?  ok. if this course wasn't available, is there another way you can learn this material?on the coursera site, there's a lot of different courses and some of them are in the same category. for example, before this course, i was learning another course. it was named the statistics making sense of data for the university of toronto.it was amazing but i think that course was very fundamental topics about statistics. i really like your course because it describes some of the advanced topics like...not advance for me. it's advanced topics like inference and regression, multi   regression and some things like this.that is very important for me. that is very important and i really like it.so far, how many hours have you spent per week on the course?how many hours do you estimate that you spent per week on the course?this course or totally? this course.i didn't predict the time but i spent a lot of time on this course because some of the weeks, you need a lot of exercise and you need a lot of time to understand the topics and fully understand them because of the next session.average, i think for each week, i spend around six hours, six to eight hours.i spend the whole day at a week for each session of this course.\t\t do you do all the course work on one day? so you do all at once?you mean repeat this subject? do you do all the course work on one day?at the starting, yes. the most important or maybe hardest weeks was week 5 regarding to inference. for the inference, no i couldn't complete my course at one day.for this reason, i distributed to through the week for better understanding. but at the start of the course, yes. i did each session in a day.\t\twhat components of the course do you participate in? ok. what components of the course did you participate in? lectures, quizzes, labs...all of them.\t\thow do you feel about the different components?  how do you feel about them?i participated in all of them. unfortunately, after week 5, because of some personal problems, i couldn't pass two quizzes and one lab.but it was amazing. i'm really impressed, especially about the lab. you prepared an amazing lab for learning r, it was very useful for me.\t\thave you participated in datacamp? or do you use r? have you participated in the datacamp? or are you using r?before this course? or along the course? in the course. did you use datacamp? or did you learn it through r studio?i started with r studio but after i found out that datacamp is very useful, i continued with datacamp.\t\thow do you feel about datacamp? how do you feel about datacamp?it was amazing. it was very good for learning. i had r studio on my personal computer, but the hints and some of the guide on datacamp was very useful for me.\t\thow important is this course to you? great. glad to hear that. is it important to you just to learn the material? or are you looking to get the certificates for these classes as well?firstly, i would like to learn some things about statistics and the material. by the way, i am trying to get the certificate, but unfortunately because of some restriction regarding my country i couldn't pay the money for the certificate.but the certificate was very valuable for me.can you tell me about your interaction with other students in the class? can you tell me about any interaction you've had with other students in the class?unfortunately no. i didn't have any interaction with other students. i would like it, but unfortunately i couldn't. i don't have enough time        i'm working full time and besides working i'm trying to learn statistics.\t\tare you interested in forming a community with your peers? why or why not? ok. would you be interested, if you had more time, in forming a community with your peers on google plus, or linkedin, or facebook?if i correctly understand your words, i am trying to contact other resources like facebook, google plus, but i didn't use them. i focused on your video, and lab, and some materials.\t\tare you taking this course with anyone you personally know?  are you taking this course with anyone that you know?my friends? i recommended this course to some of my friends but unfortunately, no, they couldn't participate in this course, because they haven't enough time.\t\twould you recommend this specific course to anyone you know?  why did you recommend it to them, specifically?your course, or coursera? this course.as i mentioned, one of the most interesting things was the lab, boot camp. boot camp was amazing for me, but the material and syllabus...i found many useful things in your course, one of them, the lab, another, the syllabus was very interesting for me.also, maybe one of the impressive things about the course was the open book. mrs. mine provided lots of open materials for the students. i really like this kind of working. i am a fan of open source. open source software, open source philosophy. i'm really impressed with these things.how does your coursera learning experience compare to your past educational experiences?  great. how would you say your coursera learning experience compares to past educational experiences?evolutionary. [laughs] it's amazing. i really liked it. before coursera, i didn't believe in online learning. because of some limitations, maybe i don't have enough time for experience. but coursera has completely changed my mind.i'm a computer specialist. it was amazing for me that i'm a computer specialist but i don't like online learning. i like it, but i don't believe in it, comparing with university.but coursera, especially some courses, like your course, impressed me, and i understand that the evolution has happened.have you heard of any criticisms of coursera courses? do you have any criticisms? if so, what are they?  do you have any criticisms of coursera courses, then?about coursera, i don't have any criticism about the course setup, but i think...no, i don't have anything. i predict in the future, maybe some professors provide some specific and very deep topics.as i've seen in coursera, i found a lot of fundamental courses about different topics. i think deep subject courses are very detailed when compared with the fundamentals.i predict in the future there will be change.how has this course affected how you feel about chemistry statistics? how has this course affected your opinion of statistics?it was amazing. i really liked the start of the course, weeks one, two and three. it really helped me to understand the fundamental topics of statistics, fundamental terms.honestly, i had a lot of problems with the statistics, because in my bachelor's, i didn't like statistics and mathematics. this course, especially this year, because i'm really interested in the data analytics, this course changed my mind about statistics. it's easily learned, the fundamentals of statistics. glad it's changed your opinion.it was really amazing for me. because previously, i don't like statistics and basic terms on...i don't like the course. but at this moment, i completely changed. my mind completely changed.\t\thow likely are you to take more chemistry statistics classes?  do you plan on taking more statistics courses in the future?yes. for sure. absolutely. i like.is there anything else you   d like for me to know?  i don't have any other questions. do you have anything else that you'd like for me to know, or any questions that you have?i heard some things about the course. yes, i would like to say some things about the balance of the syllabus. i understand that week five and six had more difficult in compared with the other weeks. i think maybe your syllabus is similar to the normal distribution, and the top of the normal distribution was week five and week six.it takes a lot of time for me to understand the topics of week five. especially about inference and confidence interval. generally, i think your course was amazing. especially relevant to the open book. also, applets was very useful. applets was very useful. the lab was an evolutionary task. evolutionary work for learning. i'm glad you enjoyed it. do you have any questions for me about the course or our research?i read a lot of things about the course and especially about dr. mine i don't want to know about more because i find a lot of things about her on the internet. but i really like to know about the research topics. future research topics of your department and your team. i'm a statistics and computer science double major at duke. we got a grant to do this research. we've put up two coursera courses. one in data analysis, that you were taking, and then one in chemistry, because both professors wanted to start the coursera student experience.we're interested in learning about different ways of measuring success because many students don't complete the certificate. they just want to use the tools to learn more for themselves. we're very interested in seeing how we can measure success in the future.once the course finishes, we'll be able to get all the data from who's been participating and how long people have been spending and seeing how we can make the course better in the future.you have analytics your data again. yeah. basically.that's the case of study, yes? it seems a lot of cases study your courses. we have both courses at duke university and they're very similar, so we're trying to compare the coursera student experience versus the in   class student experience.that's good. wonderful. have you any plan for the advanced topics or advanced courses in coursera, or no? at this moment, i think we're just trying to stick with this one course. hopefully in the next year or so we'll be able to put up another one. there are talks about it. i think it's just finding the time to plan it.i don't know is it possible or not. can i know about the experience...? sorry, can you repeat?are you satisfied with this course or not? sorry, i think you cut in and out. can you repeat that question?oh, sorry. i asked about the feedback and opinion about the course experience at coursera. i would like to know about your opinion after this course. i took a coursera course myself last year in cryptography. i think this course is definitely very different, just being on this end and seeing. there's a lot more participation on the forums that i've seen. people are very...i think this course definitely is different than other courses that i've seen on coursera. at least just with student responses. people have been using the different social media devices and participating in the forums. there's also a very wide range of students who are taking it. many people, like yourself, have a lot of computer...excuse me again. i couldn't hear your voice again. i don't know. it's a technology problem again. always. yes. i think one of the main differences that i've seen is that there's a very wide range of students. many students like yourself have a lot of computer background, but not this...a wide, major range? it's a different... in backgrounds. many students have computer science background but no statistics. there's also many students who just have no background at all. it's interesting to see students who have gotten their phd's or master's who are going back to learn this material.phd student person in your class? there's a very wide range, so it's interesting to see that phd students who have also taken statistics before are going back to the introductions.yes, it was amazing. i really liked that course and i'm... sorry, i think you cut out....repeat this course again. because i think i need more information and i need to review an amount of topics and this course. do you have any other questions for me?no. thank you very much. ok, great. we will send you the $20 amazon gift certificate within the next week or so. if you have any questions at a later time, please feel free to contact me at that duke moocs gmail....where can i find a duke position? just a position regarding data analytics and multidisciplinary future research? sorry. you cut out at the beginning of the question. i didn't hear it.i said i'm looking for the phd position regarding to the [inaudible 25:49] data analytic... it cut out....the statistics and computer science. where can i find more information about that for the duke university? if you go to stat.duke.edu, there's a lot of information about the phd program there.i can contact with you by email, i think. these noises make a lot of problem for us.\tS1\tMale\tGraduate\t<20000\t25-34\tIran\tAsia\tStat\n",

[laughs]  hi. sorry, can you hear me now?  yes, i can.  so sorry about that.  no, don't worry. i'm not in a hurry, so it's ok.  i have a little spiel to go through before we start.  ok.\t  my name's  and i'm an undergraduate student at duke university in the united states. i'm part of the research team for the data analysis and statistical inference course. i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience.  ok.  so, in about...  pleased...  sorry.[laughter]  no, that's fine. pleased to meet you, .  nice to meet you.in about the next 20 minutes, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course and some questions about how you feel about coursera. you can tell me as much or as little as you like. if you prefer not to answer, that's perfectly fine.your privacy is important to me. so, after this interview is over, i'll remove your name and email address from my notes. this way nobody who reads my research will have access to the information on your identity.  ok.  your email address will be stored separately, so that we can send you the $20 amazon gift certificate as a token of our gratitude and afterwards, all of the identifying information will be destroyed.  ok.  just to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i'd like to audio record our conversation, if that's ok with you?  that's 100 percent. i'm fine with that.  afterwards, after it's transcribed i'll delete the recording. your participation is completely voluntary and at any point, you may choose to stop and it won't affect your class performance nor does the instructor know whether or not you participated in the research.  ok.  i just want to confirm that you're 18 years or older.  yes. i am.  great. thank you. if you could just tell me a little about yourself. what kind of work you do? what do you like to do in your spare time? that'd be great.  all right. i work for the essential impact arm of a mobile social network in south africa. it's a company called mxit and i work for mxit reach. we mainly work with ngos and not   for   profit organizations and we develop projects on mobile that focus on health, education, and counseling. i'm part of the team that we've just launched a project that focuses on early childhood development and we've been getting a lot of data back from it.i'm not that familiar with processing data, so the course is helping me perform better in my job, and understanding the data and understanding technology to really filter through the data and make sense of it.it's mainly been worthy feedback that we've been getting since we've asked parents to observe what they've noticed in their child, the behavior. i've actually found that the coursera course has been quite helpful.  oh yeah, good.  i basically manage those kinds of mobile projects and then what i do as well is i compile presentations and so on. again, a lot of the data makes sense there.in my spare time, i actually enjoy reading. i'm a little bit of a mook junkie [laughs] . i think so. i've been really in a few courses lately, and in my spare time i try and catch up as much as i can.  what other courses have you taken?  also at the moment i'm busy with the interactive programming course through python. i think it's the rice university that's presenting that one.because i work with mobile development projects, it's imperative that i've got a strongish programming knowledge, just so i can understand better what timelines would look like, and how development would actually impact the delivery time.  how have you found the coursera courses?  i've actually found them very enjoyable. i think what i do enjoy is the freedom, so i don't necessarily have to participate in all the quizzes and all the assignments if i don't want to.i have been rolling in courses, so we're actually just looking at the historic data in some of the courses that i've already completed. it's nice to just look at those videos and see what was presented in a course, and then sometimes hoping that it will be presented again.  have you taken any courses for fun, or mostly for work?  most of it is just related to work. a lot of it's been focusing on data analysis. i've completed another data analysis course, i think, from toronto. that was last year. i completed the social network analysis course, which was also last year. a lot of it has to do with acquiring skills that have been helping me in my job.  very nice. what is your academic background?  psychology. [laughs] social science. i've got a social science background. i've been working in technology, basically, since i finished my studies. i've got a bachelor's degree in social sciences.  have you had any background in statistics before?  no. no, wait, i've actually enrolled in a maths and stats course when i was finished. i did it through, or i tried it through unisa, which is south africa's long   distance learning institution. i've just found that the student support there is nonexistent.trying to juggle a maths and stats degree while working        because i was working full   time at that point already        so trying to juggle that was not practical. i passed most of my subjects, but i didn't really do as well as i wanted to. then, just the cost of it started really escalating. that wasn't ideal.  if this course wasn't available, is there another way that you think you could learn, specifically, this material?  not the material, per se. we've got as a part of mxit        the mobile social network that i work for also has a market research arm. they've been running a lot of mobile surveys. they could have been through [inaudible 0747] or an internship with the market research arm of mxit that i could have probably acquired some of the skills.i don't think really getting to know r, that wouldn't. the data team and the market research company mainly focuses on using query, so sql and databases like that. i find r quite a neat tool to use.  it's definitely helpful.  yes. [laughs]  so far, how many hours would you estimate that you've spent per week on the course?  i don't think i've actually been spending enough, to be honest. we are actually working on rolling out a competition, so my workload's been such that i haven't completed any of the quizzes over the last two weeks.mainly, when i've been getting to the course is over weekends. then, i spend about six, seven hours over the course of the weekend, to just catch up on all the video lectures and complete the quizzes, and if there's an exam.there was a midterm recently, which i finished. i've been mainly been spending weekends on the courses.  are you interested in getting the certificates for the classes, or is it more important just to learn the material?  for me, it's more important to know the material and get enough time to practice it. i think because i don't really work in a data field, per se, it's not that important for me to actually have the qualification. it is always neat to say, \"oh, yeah, i can do that.\"  what components of the course have you participated in? i know you said the quizzes, you haven't been able to do for the past couple weeks. what about the lectures and labs?  yes. video lectures, labs, i really enjoyed. it's not, what is it? datacamp. that's really been very, very cool.  you've been using that, as opposed to r?  yes. i enrolled, last year, there was also another data course by i think it was stanford. is that the one in new york?  that one's in california. [laughs]  oh, california, so maybe not stanford. i can't remember which university now. that was an 11    or 12   week course, so about halfway through the course my workload also really increased and then i couldn't finish it. so i've got a little bit of exposure to r in that course. i actually used r interface there.with this one i've mainly been using datacamp, which i find very nice. it reminds me of codecademy. it's also that interactive like \"yey, you did good\"![laughter]  it's always a lot of encouragement, which is nice, i felt.  yes. i'm sure that if i actually try and use r studio, i'll be able to pick it up rather quickly just with what's been taught in datacamp.  it's definitely very similar, so it wouldn't be that much of a learning curve. what about the lectures?  the lectures, i've watched. i'm very paranoid as well, so i tend to save all the lectures i can. i download all of them and they're in a dropbox folder, so that i always have it everywhere i go. i have an iphone as well, so i sometimes use the coursera app on my phone, if i'm lying in bed and i want to catch up on lectures.it's mainly been the lectures, quizzes, labs that i've interacted with. sometimes i'll go to a discussion forum if i'm looking for information around a certain quiz question that i'm struggling with. but i haven't really been very interactive in the discussion forums.  that was going to be my next question [laughs] .  because i'm a bit of an introvert.  got you, yes. but would you be interested in ever forming a community with your peers in coursera or google+ or facebook?  i think essentially if i can spend a bit more time on it, that's also been one of the contributing factors, it's that i don't really have much time. so it's been sit down, or get home, sit down, quickly do, watch a few lectures, try to do the quiz of the weekends. i feel that sometimes i might be a little bit behind. that's why i normally use the discussion groups, for archive or historic information of what was said.  how do you think that your coursera learning experience compares like past educational experiences?  it's a lot more convenient. i've got a slight bit of an advantage, because i finished high school through correspondence. i was 17, 18 years old, so through that i already learned how to be self   disciplined, to actually sit down and do what you need to do when you've got time, obviously.  and not procrastinate.[laughter]  through university, it's always been that lecturer in a class. we had very, very big groups in psychology, so you never really got that personal interaction with your lecturer. i think if i had carried on postgraduate, then probably classes get a lot smaller after that.then, as i've mentioned with the tertiary, long   distance education, was not at all practical or successful. compared to that, coursera, even with the course having tens of thousands of students, it feels like you actually have more information available than you did through unisa, for instance.they also have didn't neat resources, like video lectures or audio lectures.  have you heard of any criticisms of coursera, or do you have any criticisms of it?  from an impact measurement, i heard about people, i think it's mainly researchers, saying it's not really feasible and you don't really learn anything, because you can't measure the impact that it has eventually, later in life or in your work, unless you do research surveys like you are currently doing now.that's basically the only criticism i've really been dealing with. there's a colleague of mine whose wife also does the odd coursera course every so often and she also just had good things to say about it.  have you taken any courses with her?  no, not per se. i have with another colleague of mine. it was an english writing course.  would you say it's easier to take it with someone you know or easier by yourself?  in that case, i think it was a little bit more competitive. like \"hey, don't forget to do your assignment\" or \"i did mine first, yoo   hoo\"! so there was that bit of competition. i would definitely encourage doing it with someone you know, especially if you've got a bit more of a competitive personality.  those are all the questions that i have for you. is there anything else you'd like for me to know about the course, or coursera and your experiences?  i'm not sure how familiar you are with south africa and with its educational policies, or its current standards of education.  not really.  south africa is kind of a weird place, it's between a third and a first   world country and that's also why we do a lot of educational projects on mobile phones. not a lot of people have conventional access to the internet, so the majority of people in the country access the internet through their mobile phones, mainly through mobi   sites and so on.tertiary education is very expensive, so being able to actually further my education and learn new things online at a very little cost, if i'm not in the signature tracks, that's one massive advantage.  definitely, yes.  i wouldn't actually have gone to university. because my father's a lecturer there, personnel children's studies get subsidized. i wouldn't actually even have been able to afford tertiary education without my father being a lecturer there. even the tertiary education, or the long   distance education, which you'd think would be a bit more affordable, is also very expensive.  definitely. do you think a lot of people would take courses online through their mobile phones?  yes, if that's available. we've seen quite a lot of uptake on the educational apps that we've been developing. we've got a lot of informal settlements in the country. most of the towns have got like a township or an informal settlement, that's basically like a shack.you don't always have access to electricity, so they tend to use your low   end feature phones, slightly low   cost phone that's still internet   capable. because those nokia's batteries last forever, almost.if you can't charge your phone every day that's quite a practical solution to have your world on your low   feature phone. we've actually also seen a lot of uptake on mobile reading. again, if a few live in an area which doesn't always have electricity, but your phone's got a backlight, it's actually quite an advantage.so i think through mobile, yes, but that also depends on the bandwidth cost that would be associated with it. in my experience, a lot of people in our country are on prepaid air time...  that's wifi?  no, we've got very little wifi hotspots.  ok.  a few townships would have like an outlying internet cafe, where people can go. but then again, that's also a little bit of a higher cost.we do have some developments. my previous boss is currently rolling out free wifi in underdeveloped communities in gauteng at the moment, which is one of the provinces in south africa. that would contribute a lot to education and especially if high schools can be covered with wifi, that's quite an advantage.  yes, that's awesome.  at the moment, you might get free wifi at the airport, but then it's always like a login and you always have to go somewhere and struggle to get a code or a password. it's way too much effort. [laughs]  it's a lot of effort, yes.  yes.  do you have any other questions for me? or about the course?  i don't think about the course, really, but this has actually been quite a lot of fun. i've been in psychology studies as well, we're introduced to devising and conducting interviews and so on. that would be something that would be quite cool, like i'll be actually setting up interviews. what kind of questions you ask and how you phrase it. that's also something that i haven't seen on coursera before, to be honest.  we're doing like a big research on these courses that we're putting up. we're putting up the statistics course and an introduction to chemistry course, so i'm working for both teams. i'm a statistics major, but we got this big grant to do this research, so we're just trying to        once the courses are over        figure out what the best way is to measure student experience.many students don't have the intention of actually completing the certificate, so we're trying to figure out what the best way is to measure success in these courses. it's been very interesting to see everyone's responses.oh, no. did you cut out?[cuts off]  sorry, can you hear me now?[]  hello.  hello. sorry about that.  [inaudible 026] all right because i am actually sitting at work, because the internet connection's a slight bit better but they do sometimes do maintenance on it, so it [inaudible 036] on our side.  definitely. i'm not sure that the last thing you heard was.  i think it was around the research grant and measuring students' experience of coursera courses.  definitely. we've just been trying to figure out what's the best way to measure success for these courses. once these courses are finished, since this is the first time running them, we'll get all the data from it and see how we can improve it in the future.  i am very happy with the content. very happy with electra as well. i found that there was the previous test scores which had come to one of the universities close to new york, she did mention the new york the one day, the biggest was extremely long, so i found myself actually getting so distracted after a while.what i liked about mina, what i liked about her videos were they were under 10 minutes, which actually makes it a lot more convenient to watch. her presentations were very nicely done.  i'm glad you enjoyed them.  like i say, they're quite interactive, and you could actually get a pretty clear idea. it wasn't death by powerpoint. just enough information. that i can borrow someday in my future presentations [laughs] .  she's a great lecturer. she has the same course at duke, or a very similar course. we're also trying to compare the results of students in the course at duke, compared to on coursera.  that would be quite interesting data, i'm sure.  definitely. we're just waiting to get all the data back and do all the analysis.  very, very cool.  do you have any other questions?  no, i don't think so.  ok, great. we'll send you the amazon gift certificate within the next week or so, once all the interviews are completed. if you have any questions in the future you can definitely email me at the duke moocs email.i hope you enjoy... i think the course is over by sunday, but i hope you enjoyed the course. thank you so much for participating in our survey.  yeah, it's been kind of a pleasure. it's always interesting to see how things are going to be on the other side. [laughs]  we've definitely enjoyed putting together the course and meeting people all over, through the discussion forums, and through the interviews.  yes. i do find myself, always quite surprised that i find other people from south africa taking the course! it's always like, \"other people know about it\"? [laughs]  there's a lot of people, i'd say. it's very interesting to see the difference in countries, and who's able to take the courses.  yes. i can really [inaudible 352] imagine.  that's all i have. i hope you have a great rest of your day. thank you so much.  yes, yourself! it's been a pleasure talking to you!  you, as well. thank you.  all right, .  have a great day.  thank you, too.  bye.  bye.      transcription by castingwords\tS10\tFemale\tBachelor\t20000-34999\t25-34\tSouth Africa\tAfrica\tStat\n",
      "22\t:  hi, this is .  hi.:  can you hear me ok, ?  you're going in and out a little.:  ok. is this better?  yes. that's better. thank you.:  ok.  i just have a little spiel to go through before we start the interview.:  sure.  my name is  and i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of a research team for the data analysis and statistical inference course.i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience. in the next 20 minutes or so, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course and some questions about how you feel about coursera courses in general.you can tell me as much or as little as you like. if you prefer not to answer some questions, that's perfectly fine as well.your privacy is also very important to me. after this interview is over, i'll remove your name and email address from my notes. this way, nobody who reads the research will have access to the information on your identity.your email address will be stored separately, so that we can use that to send you the $20 amazon gift certificate as a token of our gratitude. after we send all those out, all the identifying information will be destroyed.just to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i'd like to audio record our conversation if that's ok with you.:  yes, sure.  after my notes and the audio recording from our conversation are transcribed, i'll delete the recording. also, your participation is completely voluntary. at any point, you may choose to stop the interview.your interview won't affect your class performance in any way, nor will the instructor know whether or not you participated in the research. also just want to confirm that you're 18 years or older?:  yes, that's true.  thank you. if you could tell me about yourself, what your neighborhood's like, what kind of work you do. what do you like to do in your spare time? that would be great.:  i work with databases. i've been doing that for more than 15 years now. that was my primary interest in the course. did you say, what the neighborhood is like?  or just like, what do you like to do in your spare time, just stuff about yourself. it doesn't matter.:  oh, ok. [laughs] basically i have two kids, 16 and 10. they take up a lot of the spare time that i have.i'm really interested in these online courses. it gives me a chance to take courses from really good universities and with professors you would normally not get a chance to interact with.that's why i do take some online courses, too. whenever i can manage to fit them in.  what is your academic background?:  i have a bachelor's in chemical engineering.  have you had any background in statistics specifically?:  yes, as part of my undergraduate.then i did do some online courses on statistics.  what made you decide to enroll in this course?:  mainly because i was covering inference, too. in most of the other courses it was just statistics not too much emphasis on inference.that was one of the reasons why i wanted to take this course and the course intro video was really interesting and seemed to be useful.  how do you plan to use this material?...if you plan to use it all [short laugh]:  you know i'm interested in the data science field? so i hope that this course will help me transition to that as a career.immediate use, i am not really sure. i do some bi too. you know, business intelligence? it might come in handy or useful there.  if this course wasn't available, is there another way you could learn the material?:  probably, but i don't know how much i would have learned. i think i'm pretty confident that whatever i know now after the course. maybe 60 to 70 percent if i try to do it on my own.  so far how many hours have you spend per week in the course if you could estimate?:  i would say maybe an hour a day on the weekdays and may be two to three hours on the weekends.  what components of the course do you participate in most like lectures, the quizzes, labs?:  the lectures for sure, the quizzes. i wanted to do the labs but i didn't have enough time so i decided to concentrate more on the lectures and the quizzes.  how do you feel about the lectures and the quizzes then?:  i am really impressed with the lectures. the profile server is really brilliant but the presentation, the format that are really amazing. that has been really helpful in understanding.  glad that you like them. what about the quizzes? do you think those are helpful?:  oh yes, the quizzes were helpful.  how important would you say the course is to you? do you plan to try and get the certificate or you are just doing it for your own general knowledge.:  i do plan to get the certificate because i am on that signature track.  ok.:  that has been one of my objectives.  can you tell me about any interactions you have with other students in the class.:  not too much. there were some other students who are geographically closer, so we did plan on forming like a virtual study group but that didn't work out too well. other than that i have been browsing through the discussion forums.  what didn't work with the planning? was that just time schedule?:  we just couldn't figure out a way to get everyone at the same time.  are you taking the course with anyone you know personally?:  no.  how would you say the coursera learning experience compares to your past educational experiences.:  this is not a first coursera course. i am kind of used to the format and the way things work so it hasn't been a big change because i'm used to it.compared to, if you are asking about my under graduate experience, yes it's a completely different thing in the sense that you have to manage the time.it's completely online so there isn't physical resource that you can go to, to get your doubts clarified. in that way it's different. i wouldn't say it's an inferior experience. it's just been a different experience.  has this course affected how you feel about coursera? has it changed any of your opinions of it or still the same?:  no. i still think coursera as...i did some courses from adex and udacity too and i think coursera is still the best. this course just re   enforce that.  what other kind of courses are you taking of coursera. would you be interested in taking coursera for fun or for school or work?:  on coursera i am signed up for the data science specialization. you know jones hopkins?  yes.:  that is something i am taking. adex has a course called [inaudible 10:30] matrix 101? that's interesting and also a way to keep my knowledge current in the sense that whatever i learned from this course might be helpful in that course too.  got you, and how has this course affected how you feel about statistics?:  i always had a problem with probability and this course has really clarified a lot of things, though i would say my understanding about the concepts has really improved by leaps and bounds.  would you recommend this specific course to people that you know?:  yes, i would.  do you have any criticisms of coursera courses or have you heard of any?:  not really, but the only difference between this course and the other courses that i took was the grading policy. this was the first time that i saw grading policy that was so strict. that was kind of different compared to the other course that i took.  how did the other courses...[crosstalk]:  i am sorry. i didn't get that.  how is it different than the other courses are?:  they have a range. like, you have a minimum that you'll need to get in order to get a certificate. the minimum is usually lower than the 80 percent cut off that we have.  ok, but i think the professor has the discretion to rule that threshold afterwards based on how people do. it is not a concrete 80 percent, but...:  it is not really a criticism. it is more like this was the first time i have seen this. it's a kind of a motivator too, so that you know you have to put in some effort in order to get the certificate.  definitely.:  kind of makes you feel that you earned it. that is one good thing about this.  those are basically most my questions. is there anything else you'd like for me to know about the course or do you have any questions for me?:  , were you one of the people who are from the materials?  sorry, say again.:  were you one of the people who were from course materials?  yes, i help to take the labs and putting together the quizzes and stuff.:  i just wanted to thank you guys because i think you guys did an amazing job there.  [laughs] thank you very much.:  right from the first lesson, all the presentation material, the in   lesson quizzes and the quizzes themselves, they all really helped to reinforce the concepts. this was one of the best put together courses that i have taken.  thank you. i am glad you liked it. we are just trying to get all the feedback we can, so that we can improve it for the future and make sure that we cater towards all the student's needs.:  there was one other thing. i got an email recently that said that after the course finishes we will have access to the materials until the next duration of the course, but on the other coursera courses it is not like that.once you pass the course it stays on your record and you can always access the materials.  ok. it might be something that i can look into and see because i am not one of the teacher who started it. i don't know if she knew, because it was her first coursera course. she had to make all these decisions at the beginning without knowing exactly what is the standard.:  right.  i can definitely look into seeing if that can be extended to just...if you pass, just always having that access.:  ok. in the future, are you guys going to have a roadmap of the like suggest the courses people should take?  at this point, we don't have any courses that we're putting up yet. i think we are trying to put up another one within the next year, but i am not sure yet.:  ok. how different is this course from the course duke students take?  professor [inaudible 16:29] rendell actually teaches the exact same course at duke university. the only difference is the labs and quizzes, but for the most part of course it is exactly the same.because the labs are a little more user friendly on the coursera one because not everyone has the coding background.other than that, there's not that many differences.do you have any other questions for me?:  no, i think i'm good.  you will receive the amazon gift card in your email within the next week or so. we will probably send the mail when all the interviews are complete, and then we are really appreciative that you give us your feedback and that you're enjoying the course and i hope the rest of the course goes off for you.:  ok thanks and  i have a request.  mm   hmm.:  i really don't want that gift card. if you have some sort of fund where you help out people who want to sign up for the signature track but can't, you can just put it there.  thank you. thank you very much. we'll definitely look into that. i'll email you to let you know where that is going if you would like.:  yes, that's fine. whatever you guys decide i'm sure it will be fine.  thank you very much. if you have any questions later, you can contact me at the dukemoocs gmail.com.:  ok.  thank you so much. hope you have a great rest of your day.:  thank you.  bye.:  bye.transcription by castingwords\tS11\tMale\tBachelor\t100000+\t25-34\tUnited States\tAmerica\tStat\n",

[indecipherable 0:03:02] object oriented languages. i had a good [indecipherable 0:03:06] of complete software development life cycle and i was pretty interested in learning data analytics and data science.so, that's why i opted this course and it's a good experience of course.  did you have any background in statistics before you took the course?:  no. i did have detailed class teaching experience. but i had a few weeks of training from my office, when they started looking for some data analytics projects.i had 10   15 hours of training. that is very small knowledge before the course.  how do you plan to specifically use this material that you've learned?:  from this course, is it?  yes.:  i downloaded all the videos on the course, so i count all the videos as a knowledge base. all these were very detailed course about basics of probability, statistics, variables. prediction and categorical or inference variable. it's definitely a good knowledge base for me proceed further.  if this course wasn't available to you online, is there another way you could have learned the material?:  online is only one of the best way of learning for me. other than that, if we had the opportunity to go for a class orientation on a weekend basis, i would also definitely go for that.  if you can estimate so far how many hours have you spend per week on the course?:  on a weekend, definitely you spend more or less 10 hours a week.  what components of the course do you participate in most?:  i participated in listening to all the videos and answering the questions of the quizzes and lab assignments. but i've not worked more on the discussion forums or reading research topics or advanced topics        that, i have to do later on.  how do you feel about the lectures, the quizzes, and the labs, especially?:  the lecturers were awesome. it was very basic. especially, the professor handled the way is very nice. she taught us a very detailed view of the concepts. even the quizzes and labs, the questions were little tricky. it made us think in more than one dimension to answer the questions. so it's a tough time to handle all of them.  what about the labs? do you think they helped you with your understanding of the topic?:  yes, of course.  have you had any interactions with the other students in the class?:  very sadly i missed the hang out sessions, but from the discussion forums, i got a few of my indian friends who are also enrolled in the same course. so we got that linkedin sometimes and have been in touch with them. so probably, may have a chance to meet them in the future.  have you been studying with them, or do you know they are talking to them?:  no, that didn't happen yet. if that is the course or them voluntarily interested in it definitely i'll go for it.  how would you say your coursera learning experience compare to past educational experiences?:  definitely this almost simulates classroom based learning. so, way to go. definitely i'll go out for more courses if my interest matches.  has this course affected how you feel about statistics?:  yeah.  positively, i hope? [laughs]:  i am very sorry, i didn't hear you properly. your voice was not audible.  i am sorry. how has this course affected how you feel about statistics?:  since i am from a database, date handling division, we have a good vision on data   analytics, how this field is going to play a major role in the future. so we are all interested. especially i am interested in data   analytics learning. i may also look out for some full   time courses from universities like dukes. i am interested in it.  would you recommend this specific course to anyone that you know?:  yeah, i've already recommended this course to four to five of my colleagues in my organization. they are also pursuing it.  how likely are you to take more statistics classes?:  are there any plans for advanced level of this course in the future, from the same professor?  at this point, i don't think so, but they are trying to work on other courses that they can put out, but i know there is another one from other universities that's coming up, starting in a couple of days. but i don't think professor randall is doing another one at this time.:  she might be busy.  yeah. how has this course affected how you feel about coursera or other online course websites?:  i have seen some of the online portals like udersity and also few of the other. compared to all of them, coursera seems to be a pretty decent portal with easy links to access videos, download material, time based quizzes and assignments, even projects and assessment of peer reviews. so, coursera stood unique when compared to other portals.  would you recommend coursera to other people?:  yeah, of course.  how likely are you to take another coursera course, one for fun or one for school or work, again?:  i am interested in taking multiple courses, but time management is a really critical part that we need to handle more than one program at the same time, watching all videos, keeping track of videos and assignments on time. so it's tough for me to manage, but i am interested into taking up few other courses in future.  did you see any of that you're interested in?:  yeah, i have seen a few but a few things then...they're asking us to pay for full, complete certification. a few things are stopping me from taking more courses but if the course is worth of the thing then i'll definitely go ahead.  ok. have you heard any criticisms of coursera courses, or do you have any criticisms of them?:  no, no, nothing.  ok, great. those are actually all the questions that i have for you. is there anything else you'd like for me to know about the course itself?:  yeah. i have seen that the statement of accomplishment will be awarded for distinction with more than 80 percent. what if a student scored less than 80 percent, say about 70 or above 65? will they get a statement of accomplishment?  i think the professor, that's at her discretion. once everyone's scores are in or whatever, once the course is over, then she'll decide. for right now, it's at 80 percent, but she can change that threshold depending on how everyone does.:  ok. if you're interested in taking up a lot of project   based experience from data analytics concepts, which approach should be best to follow? because after following this course we got to know a lot about the fundamentals and basics of data analytics statistics inferences. so, is it for the lot of assignments and doing some real time projects? will university or the course will help us to form some groups, share some data or having some resident students' guidance?can you please help me on how to take up more results projects?  duke university has a bayesian department, which is a different type of statistic. for the most part, we teach courses in bayesian, but i am also very into like big data after college. so i guess, in my experience, i've a lot of concept classes involved but then also if you were interested in learning about regression, that is very useful. learning more about that is very helpful.:  ok. can you please share with some professional id to communicate with you to get some guidance from you?  sorry, say that again?:  can you please share your personal or professional skype or some ways to get in touch with you, get some guidance from you on doing some real   time projects? not to be on a purely research   based but to do some projects so that we'll gain some real   time experience that will help us in getting to a job or getting a high profile job.  if you just email to the email that i contacted you at over the week, like dukemoocs gmail, then i'll respond to that and then i'll be looking at that so i can always just help you if you have any questions.:  sure. can you share my email in a skype conversation?  only if you are ok with it being...it might be in the transcriptions but you can email to me if you would like, or message it afterwards.:  to the dukemoocs, is it?  ahem.:  oh, that's right, thank you.  ok.:  yeah, hang on, i have one more question        just a second. i was trying to buy that book which professor was working on. so i searched the amazon site but it is available as a hard copy only in us. in india, i am not sure how to buy the book. so do you have any idea on it?  i am not actually sure, but i think on the coursera website, there is a link to get it. there might be a download somewhere that you could look up on.:  [indecipherable 0:15:20] book as a soft copy, but i prefer reading books in a hard copy format, but then it's not available in india. so i got some of that.  yeah, if it's not available yet, then it might be in the future but at this time, i don't think it would be possible to get a...:  ok. finally, will these courses encourage students to join duke university or do we have some preference if we complete some kind of certification like this? do we have a preference for joining duke university in future?  this course is completely separate from duke university. it's just taught by duke university professor.[crosstalk]:  ok.  i don't know how much it would help, but it's definitely worth pursuing if you're interested.:  yeah, i'll definitely search for some post   graduate courses that i would like to see that after some time.  do you have any other questions?:  no, that's it. thank you.  ok great. if you have any other questions at a later time, definitely email me at the dukemoocs gmail and we will send you the $20 amazon gift certificate later on this week.thank you so much for your time. we really appreciate your participation and recommendation through the course. so yeah, thank you so much. you have a great day.:  thank you, and can i have your name once again please?:  oh yes, it's .:  ok. thank you.  bye   bye then. great.:  thank you.  have a great day.:  thank you so much.[]:  shall i end the conversation?transcription by castingwords\tS12\tMale\tBachelor\t<20000\t25-34\tIndia\tAsia\tStat\n",
      "24\thello.:  hello. ?  hi, . how are you?:  hi. i'm sorry i'm not getting a photograph, i doubt if you're getting a picture of me.  i have my video off.[laughter]  thank you so much for agreeing to going through the interview process. i just have a little spiel i have to through just to make sure.my name is . i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of the research team for the data analysis and statistical inference course on coursera. i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience.in the next like 30 minutes, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and some question about how you feel about coursera courses, in general. you can tell me as much or as little as you would like. if you prefer not to answer some questions, that's perfectly fine.your privacy's also very important, so after this i'll remove your name and email address from all of my notes so nobody who reads the research can access your identity. your email address will be stored separately and a transcript of our interview from that and you'll be sent a $20 amazon gift certificate. to make sure that i understand accurately right what you tell me, i'd like to record our conversation, if that's ok with you?:  that's no problem.  if you choose to stop the conversation at any point, just let me know and it won't affect your class performance or the teachers won't know whether or not you participated in this research.i just want to confirm that you're 18 years or older.:  oh, certainly.[laughter]  if you could quickly tell me about yourself.:  i'm a mature student. i'm actually a phd student doing a self   funded phd at [inaudible 02:13] university in the uk. as part of that, i needed some stats background. i've done some stats a long time ago. i'd looked at another coursera stats course about a year ago, but found that one quite difficult to follow because of various technical reasons. we couldn't stop the videos promptly.whereas this one, if i want to think of anything or i want to look at anything, i can stop the video and i can actually think about it. i find that very helpful.  it's definitely really helpful when you want to go back and look at an equation. what kind of studies are you doing for your phd?:  paleolimnology, which is lake sediments. i'm looking at isotope data        isotopes, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. i'm hoping to relate that to climate. there's going to be quite a lot of data analysis and stuff with it. that's why i'm trying to get a better background in it.  have you had a lot statistics background? you said you had it earlier.:  i did do a course when i did my msc, but it was very quick amongst a lot of other courses, and it didn't really sink in. i have actually found that doing it this time, it sank in a lot better than it did the first time round.  how would you like to use that, what you've learned in the course? is that just for your research?:  i'll be using it as part of my phd, and as the basis for another coursera course that i want to start next week which is [inaudible 03:59] analysis one.  if this course wasn't available, was there another way that you could learn this material?:  i could have gone and got book out, but i found this is much easier. one of the things i've really liked is the exercises with this. there have been exercises to go to, that i can check that i understand what we've done. then, going on to do the quizzes.i haven't done the exam, and i'm not going to do the exam at the end of this year, because i didn't do the one in the middle. my grandson was born that week.  congratulations. more important.:  yeah, i decided it was a bit too much running around that week.  did you come in with the intent of getting the certificate? or did you just want to learn?:  no, i didn't. i came in with the intent to see how the course was, to see if i got on with it. i've looked at other coursera courses, and some i've got on with and some i haven't. each time, it's been with more \"i want to see what this is like. i'm curious about how these courses work.\"  how many hours would you say you've spent per week on the course, if you can estimate?:  it always seems to be a lot more than they say. i just said six to eight, rather than three to four.  do you think a lot of it comes into play with not knowing r? were you experienced in r before?:  no. in fact, i used the datacamp. i found the datacamp very, very frustrating. i have done programming before, but because i don't know r. i was also late starting the course, because i hadn't realized it was on.i started rushed at it, to begin with. i thought, \"i'll do the datacamp, because i don't know.\" really, i should have done the r one and done the programming, because i think that would have been much more useful for me.  do you think you'll go back and, maybe, redo the labs?:  no. what i started doing now is roger payne's r course. again, preparation for doing the course that starts next week which is also why i'm not in the bottle doing the second exam.  if you've learned the material, then that's the most important part.:  it is. that's important. it's not getting the qualification. it's the process of learning.  that's what we're trying to do a lot of research on, to see why people are actually enrolling. to see if they want to get the certificate, or if they're just doing it for their own knowledge.:  i'm sure some people will. i've got two degrees. a masters and a phd. i'm not really...[crosstalk]:  if i did want that, i would be.  can you tell me about your interaction with other students in the class, if you've had any?:  absolutely none. none whatsoever.  have you looked at any of the forums?:  no.  there's only a select group of people who actually go on them.:  some people like that sort of thing. i suppose it's partly to do with my age. i'm not great interacting on the computer. i just don't do it.  how do you feel about the lectures and the quizzes?:  the lectures were really good. she is very, very good. i really felt as if it had been drilled into me this time. [laughs]  she's a really great professor.:  yeah, she is. she absolutely is. i found the quizzes very useful, as well, because they weren't trivial. they really made you think about what you were doing. you looked at some of the options, and you thought, \"which one is it?\" you really had to have a good think about which one it was. i thought that was good.  do you think the labs helped you prepare for the quizzes?:  no. because i found datacamp very frustrating, no, i didn't find them useful at all. i might have done, if i'd done the r ones, rather than the datacamp. it said on the instructions, \"if you don't know r, go to the datacamp.\" but i've actually done programming, so i would have been better off with r than with the datacamp.  for datacamp, was it the slow connection?:  it was a slow connection. it was also the editor. when i'm typing stuff in, i've got bad habits as a programmer of copying and pasting. [inaudible 09:11] to get something, because i couldn't remember the actual instruction. go to copy it, and it's just gone, what i'd done before. [laughs]  always frustrating.:  then i'd go back to where i was, and find that had gone, as well. because as soon as you go off the page, the bottom part of the datacamp gets wiped. that was frustrating, actually.  to not see what you'd done.:  it would say things like, \"go back, and have a look at previous things that you've done.\" and you couldn't, because it's not there anymore. the standard answers are there, but anything that you've done, yourself, isn't there. i was playing around with it a bit.  this is our first time using datacamp. we're trying to work with them to see if we can take in everyone's recommendations for that, to make it better.:  i think if you hadn't been a programmer at all, it would have been fine. i just found it a bit frustrating.  because you already knew what you were doing?:  i had a better idea of what...i had a reasonable idea of what i was doing. i didn't know the actual syntax for the r. i know about programming structure.  once you learn one, you know the other one.:  exactly.  how would you say that your coursera learning experience compares with your other past educational experiences?:  this course i found really good. i enjoyed it and there's a way of doing things that you have to stop and think about. it's really helpful.normally what happens...i remember from the stats course i did years ago...you'd be going through it and you try to write down, you try to think about it at the same time as you're trying to take notes. you can't stop. if you stop, you miss something.for something like stats, it's absolutely brilliant.  i'm glad to hear that. how has this course affected how you feel about statistics? has it affected you at all?:  much more positive. i've always been very positive about statistics. i just haven't understood it that well. i understand more of what i'm doing. a lot of things slot into place this time. i'm hoping to build on that because i have to do more bayesian statistics.  are you going to learn more bayesian?:  yeah, i'm going to do quite a bit more, different forms of data analysis. i need to do some time   series data analysis as well, so i've got to get my head around that. what's the other one? it's brook change   in   time series.  i'm learning about that now.[laughter]:  you would like my data. [laughs]  would you recommend this course...[crosstalk]:  sorry?  would you recommend this course to anyone you know?:  yes.  who would you recommend it to, if you had to choose?:  anybody that wanted to do this sort of statistics, as a reminder for this or as a first introduction either, it would be a good course.  do you think it would be good for high school students, or maybe students that are past college...?:  past college. some high school students probably would be fine doing it. i don't know what your level of high school students is. i know a   level maths doesn't go...they do statistics, but we don't go into the depth that this course does.  for us, our statistics courses in high school don't go in this much depth. how has this course affected how you feel about coursera and other online courses?:  i'm quite positive about online courses but i have been for years. my second degree was an open university degree. i don't know if you've heard of the open university in britain. it's not online though they do more online stuff now. it was courses that you'd get through the post, you'd work through and send work in, things like that.the idea of doing a remote course isn't anything new but it's just a different format.  have you heard any criticisms of coursera courses or online courses that you would...:  i have in particular things. there was a criticism saying that they were going to be used so that people didn't teach. basically, the objection was de   scaling in colleges. this was particularly in the states i've heard about the criticism. i didn't think it was necessarily valid at all, because basically, if that's what the colleges are doing, the students need to get it sorted out.[laughter]  some schools are...:  that's not acceptable. it's acceptable for them to say, \"look this course is really good. let's have a go at this course and we'll sit around to discuss it and we'll do other work round it.\" maybe use some of it as a basis for a course, because another one that i looked at and didn't finish, while i was away, was a modeling course. i thought that was fantastic. the guy that did that one was really good as well.  do you think these courses could be used as additional, supplementary...?:  they could be but i think they'd have to be supplementary. they'd have to be very carefully used but i think there's definitely a place for them. there's certainly a demand in the third world, judging by the number of chinese students we have at the university and all over the place. there's a big demand for education, worldwide demand.[crosstalk]  sorry, say that again.:  it should be part of mix.  it definitely makes it easier for students who don't have access to education to get it online.:  absolutely.  how likely are you to take a different coursera course for fun? did you see any others that were interesting, that maybe weren't statistics?:  there are lots. it's finding the time to do it. i've got to have a good reason to do it.[laughter]  is there any one that stuck out to you?:  most of the ones i've looked at have been the data handling or data analysis ones. i'm looking just to see what comes up. this one with professor mencken and [inaudible 16:33] ? there's one that starts next week that i'm going to be looking at to see how i get on with that.  is there anything else you'd like for me to know about the course or suggestions for the future besides the datacamp conflicts and frustrations.:  not that i can think of at all. i really enjoyed the course.  glad to hear that. we have been working on it for a while, so trying to make sure that everyone likes it and you're getting the best methods for students to learn in different ways.there are all the questions that i have for you. do you have any questions for me, feel free to ask. if not...:  i don't think i have, actually.  we will be sending you an email with the amazon gift card. that will come in a couple of days to your email.:  thank you.  thank you so much for participating.:  you're welcome.  it's really great to meet all the students, or meet a bunch of the students and see how they like the course and why.:  it's nice to hear from the people at coursera. i do have a question actually. you said you were an undergraduate?  yes.:  you're undergraduate stats?  i'm in statistics and computer science.:  right. are you getting the data to analyze for a course or is somebody else going to do the analysis?  it's actually a project that we got huge funding for throughout the university. i'm helping professor rondell do this analysis for the course. once the course finishes, before the next course, hopefully we'll be able to get the data from coursera and improve the course for the future.it's not really for course credit, it's just...:  it's for improving the course. knowledge, understanding.  yeah.:  smashing, thanks very much. it's been very nice to speak to you.  very nice talking to you, thank you so much.:  thank you.  bye.:  bye.transcription by castingwords\tS13\tFemale\tGraduate\t50000-74999\t55+\tUnited Kingdom\tEurope\tStat\n",

 yeah.:  it is unavailable, i will learn it from youtube, but then i would not know what i do not know. probably would not pick up some of the topics or concepts taught in the structure.  do you think you would have actually watched it on youtube or probably not as much?:  probably not watch it as much.  can you estimate how many hours you spent for week on the course?:  probably seven hours.  ok. what components of the course do you participate in?[crosstalk]:  participated in the lectures and the quizzes.  awesome! so how do you feel about the lectures and quizzes and everything?:  i think the lecture is very clear. definitely advances my knowledge in this. through explanation, i'm able to understand some of those concepts we're talking about.i did not have that appreciation until i attended this lecture.  awesome! what about the quizzes and the labs?:  the quizzes are fine. the lab is very good. the labs i attended are [indecipherable 07:12] . i find that the instructions from this lecture, they are not as clear.  from this one?:  no. from the other courses. in this course, the instructions are very clear and i understand all better. also, it's good that there is an ...r... what do you call it [inaudible 07:48] ?  data camp?:  i think that's very good. so i will know which part including our...[crosstalk]  did you use mostly use data camp or did you use or..:  i only used data camp.  ok cool. how important would you say the course is to you? was it more important to get the certificate or just to learn the material in general?:  far more important than to get the certificate.  have you had any interactions with other students in the class?:  no. i did not.  did you look at the forums at all or would you be interested in forming a good community if you had time?:  the community would be good for instructions, to do for information. i did try to look for information a couple of times in the forum.other than that, i don't really use it. because i find that the content, sometimes it's distracting and it's hard to find the information you want. [inaudible 09:28]  are you taking the course with anyone you know?:  no. i'm taking it alone.  ok. how would you say your courses are a learning experience compares to pass educational experiences?:  class has been very good. with coursera, i can play the video, i can stop the video at any time. i can rewind to catch the lecture again. so it's very good.i'm able to, even if i miss some points, i can go back in the video to hear it again. one thing i do not like is that you can only get this information from videos.  from videos? is that what you said?:  yeah, you can only get the course contents from video. there are some courses which upload slides as well, but so far from my experience, majority of the lecturers, they don't upload the slides.i think there's a transcript part of coursera but a transcript is kind of hard to read. sometimes there's a lot of errors in the transcripts.  i think the powerpoints are uploaded for this course, as well, somewhere.:  there are some other course which does not have the powerpoint uploaded.  have you looked at the powerpoints on this course?:  for this course i do not have to, so far i do not have to.  how has this course affected how you feel about statistics in general?:  it makes me feel more interested.  would you recommend this specific course to other people?:  yeah, definitely.  what kind of student do you think would best would benefit most from it?:  sorry?  what kind of student would you think would benefit most from it?:  i think those students who are practicing statistics would need to use statistics to, in their daily work. it will benefit them because they will understand what the lecturer is talking about and they can apply what they have learned in their daily work as well because that's where they will need these skills.  how likely are you to take more statistics courses in the future?:  i think quite likely. now i'm already taking another statistics course. i think i will continue to do that.  how has this course affected how you feel about coursera or online courses in general?:  it made me feel that this coursera is very important. it's a very good avenue for people to learn. furthermore there's no cost to it so people can explore topics which they have no background in and it can advance their knowledge. you'll see things from different perspective as well.  so how likely are you to take another coursera course for say for fun rather than for just work?:  quite likely. quite likely.  have you seen any that have interested you?:  yes. i've taken one on irrational behavior, so it's not related to my work, but nonetheless it's very interesting. probably because of the way the lecturer, it's the way the lecturer talks and how he presents the contents.there's the other statistics course that i'm taking now, the lecturer is not so interesting so i don't feel that my learning will be enhanced much more than this course, than the statistics inference course.  have you heard of any criticisms of coursera courses or do you have any criticisms?:  no i've not heard of any. i do not have any either.  sorry, say that again?:  i've not heard of any. one thing is for coursera course, i have doubts how the certificates earned on coursera will it be recognized by employers? that's the concern i have.  are you on the signature track? do you think the signature track makes it more, makes it better for employers, or do you think neither of the certificates would be very beneficial?:  i think the certificates would be very beneficial. but how would the, because we're doing it, doing this assignments on our own, right? the exams we're doing on our own, so how would the employers know that the students did not have outside help for the exams?if i'm an employer, i would have doubt about how genuine is your skills when you have this, when you earn this certificate. sure, you have this certificate, but did you really do, did you really attend the lectures on your, did you really take part in the exams on your own or did you have outside help?  do you think there's a way that coursera could fix that or is it just inevitable because it's on the internet?:  no. the current measures with recognizing your typing pattern and taking your photo after the assignment is submitted, i think that those precautions, they are not good enough, because i've tried typing in another pattern and i've tried taking photo with someone else, and so far both methods have gone through. i don't think the checks are very effective.  those are all the questions i actually have for you. is there anything else that you'd like for me to know about your experience in the course, or any questions that you have for me?:  no, i don't.  ok. thank you so much for you participation. in the next week or so we'll send you the $20 amazon gift certificate to your email. if you have any questions at a later time, please feel free to email me at the dukemukes gmail.com email. i check that regularly, so definitely feel free to send me questions.:  ok, sure.  thank you so much for your participation. we really appreciate it.:  thank you.  no problem. have a great day.:  yeah, you too.  bye.:  bye   bye.transcription by castingwords\tS14\tMale\tBachelor\t75000-99999\t25-34\tSingapore\tAsia\tStat\n",
      "26\t:  i look at a way to improve the competence of our engineers [inaudible 00:00:12] . i guess that's about it. my background is environmental science, and work in aerospace.  what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time?:  in the last seven years i've been working, plus also doing my doctorate degree, so no more spare time in the last seven years, unfortunately.  yeah, not a lot of extra time.:  i just got my doctorate degree in january, and i guess i had a habit of really learning things. it last two or three years you have the massive online course become more and more available, and coursera been one of them, i always wanted to join.i always wanted to pick one, and now finally the doctoral degree is out of the way. it's almost instinct action to do this. yet been just to talk about a little bit why i am doing the course, because my stuff is more or less on computer science, and this statistic and data analysis is more or less a basic of what we called machinery.i want to develop myself a little bit more on machinery, so this is more or less under copying the concepts.  yes, definitely, machinery definitely becoming a lot more popular now. definitely good to know those statistic and stuff.:  yeah, and also i am also doing some machinery task in my day job, as well. just going through the concept in these courses, or maybe help me to understand a lot of stuff i am investigating on the day job.  did you have any background in statistics before?:  not specifically, because while we were doing undergrad study, when i was doing my masters while we more or less touching on some percentage, some calculation, but not intensive on statistics. this is a, as a subject, this is new to me.  what made you decide to enroll on the course? was it just for [inaudible 00:02:56] you learn like machine learning?:  yes, yes. to pick the best step towards machinery, yes. this is the prime motivation really.  if the course wasn't available online, is there another way you could have learned this material?:  if the coursera is not available, i guess i would probably go to places like fx. if this was also not available, i would probably just rely on being online. computer sites, they share a lot of stuff on the internet. probably use that for information. the difficulty would be, they are a lot more [inaudible 00:03:53] , and it's much less structured. to me the structure of study is quite important.  how many hours do you think you have spent, per week, on the course that you could estimate?:  i can actually give you the hard number, because i keep a time journal.  oh really?:  just one second.  then get it.:  no problem, so far, i spend close to, what's the number? that's 6,800 minutes divided by 60. i spent 113 hours on this, [inaudible 00:04:43] .  per week that is?:  113 hours since the course started in [inaudible 00:04:51] february.  what components of the course do you participate in most, could you say?:  that must be the [inaudible 00:05:02] . i've got to go sorry, keep on.  did you have the intention of getting the certificate or are you more doing it to take the lectures?:  the certificate for me is more or less a by   product. it's good to have it. it's good to have it, yeah, of course. but at the moment i am not sure what is the recognition actually. i am really not sure what [inaudible 00:05:36] .i really don't know, i have no idea. but the knowledge i know is real, it's in my head, it's been long time again. the fact i did from signatory tract, start paying for it. i [inaudible 00:05:58] so this just actually serves as a motivation to keep myself n hard working.  to actually do it, yeah. we are trying to figure out what motivates student to stay with the course, or if you think a certificate is the best way monitoring success.:  i think the certificate itself is [inaudible 00:06:27] for some people, how do i say, a motivator. for example, if for maybe in china or india, a certificate is most [inaudible 00:06:41] . even if it's coursera, it's still working variable.but personally because, my educational background is relative strong, so it doesn't really add that much to me. but the fact that i [inaudible 00:07:04] learning for it, it serve as a motivator for myself.of course on top of this, the amount of time i have spend on this, after you first spend first 10 hour, first 20 hour, you started to say,\" you know i really don't want to stop.\"  you can't stop at this point, yeah. how do you feel about the lecture and the quizzes project?:  lecture, very good. very, very good! yeah! the speaking is clear. the concept is clear. the presentation is very good, yeah. the only thing i would really say to you perhaps improve is that there's so many slides, is like putting together [inaudible 00:08:11] into 4d individual pdf documents.it might be a little bit difficult for people to revise, and also know when you doing exam you really don't want to switch info to different pdf documents. i am not saying! you can do anything, but a combined slide can be made available after the course, or just before the exam would be [inaudible 00:08:44] .  or like review slide but would be like review pdf or something?:  well, it doesn't have to be review, just a one document containing everything, when we do the midterm a document can become available with all the slides from week one to week three.then again, the final if you can provide one slide with everything. ever since the size is going to be big, i know that. putting together all these pdf document. second, i myself should put everything together, all the slides together.  all right, did you find that helpful?:  in fact, in the forum, i am the one who post in the general forum, i am the one who post a topic, that i put all the slide together and share it in my drop   box.  oh, ok, thank you very much for doing that.:  it's my lecture, i like to put things open [inaudible 00:09:54] . the whole thing at the moment, 35.4, 35 megabyte, it's more a small size presentation. it's about 698 slides.  wow. ok, that's not small.:  700 pages of presentation, as i say sometimes i might be able to [inaudible 00:10:23] .  how do you feel about the quizzes and the labs?[background noise]:  say again? sorry i couldn't hear.  sorry. how do you feel about the quizzes and the labs?:  and the labs?  yes.[pause]  sorry, can you hear me?:  i can now.  what is your opinion on the quizzes and the labs?:  quizzes are interesting and challenging. not much complaint. i think it's good because i really like the system. i have learned a lot from the lab, i really have learned a lot the lab. although i will say, 100 [inaudible 00:11:19] more or less end of the day, we [inaudible 00:11:22] .the quizzes, personally, i only had one quiz that i'm not getting anything right in csm. i guess it was [inaudible 00:11:39] , but then just me i believe maybe other people would say [inaudible 00:11:45]. [inaudible 00:11:49] the lab is really helpful to learn everything.  are you using r, or are you using datacam?:  i tried to participate in some open data challenge myself. i don't know whether you've heard about [inaudible 00:12:13] .  heard of what? i'm sorry.:  i don't know whether you've heard of our website called aggle, spelled a   g   g   l   e. i just started to think [inaudible 00:12:22] this open sized competition. the reason doing this also contributed with that by that way. i already set up for [inaudible 00:12:37] myself so [inaudible 00:12:39] .  how do you feel about the project?:  the project is interesting. it's interesting. there isn't much like a [inaudible 00:12:58] about the project. i spend probably 20 hours on the project altogether, it's a significant chunk of time to spend on it. [inaudible 00:13:13] , the one aspect that i didn't anticipate it to be so useful is the evaluation, the [inaudible 00:13:22]. i really appreciated the [inaudible 00:13:26] assessment.  you said that you posted on the forums. can you tell me about your interactions with other students in the class then?:  on the main coursera forum i created a post, when you go there you can see it. you see the discussion forum, the general discussion. i have a post that's combined, not just my company [inaudible 00:13:59] bookmark so i created a bookmark, so that's my main thread.i am basically updating these pdf documents, each week. i have a lot of interaction with some of the other students who are doing this. also off the coursera website i set up some blinking [inaudible 00:14:24] . i have a person who has asked why don't we share our [inaudible 00:14:31], so i have done that.off the coursera website, we have a quite a strong study group on an app called wechat, which is a chinese word of \"wats app.\"  do you find that useful with studying?:  that is useful. the group on wechat is quite useful in many ways. i get to use my first language, which is chinese. plus, it's always really good to share study with people from the same cultural background.secondly, chinese people [inaudible 00:15:30] get to know rarely [inaudible 00:15:34] . it makes them really good friend on the space. discussion group is now data analysis and statistics [inaudible 00:15:47] course coming to close. we are going to keep the discussion group live for data analytic topic, but also for coursera topic.we actually share that site what we have missed out. somebody would say there is one in [inaudible 00:16:05] , which is very good. then of course, there is another [inaudible 00:16:10], that's given out the co   founder of coursera, and that is also very good. some of us have started to share what is the next step. also, we want to share some of the [inaudible 00:16:27] data analytic topic.  did you know anyone personally when you were taking your course.:  only one person. that's a very good friend of mine whose in beijing, he [inaudible 00:16:45] .  i'm sorry. could you repeat that?:  say again?  i'm sorry. could you repeat that?:  i have a friend in beijing, which we joined together in an international cause.  how many people do you think are part of that study that you have?:  in the study group we have at the moment [inaudible 00:17:17] . at the moment we have 61 persons.  would you say most of them are involved?:  it's like any other forum [inaudible 00:17:43] discussion. we more or less have five percent of people who are posting every day, and maybe 10 percent occasional participant, 20 percent rare participant but most of the other are advice is the [inaudible 00:18:04] .  how do you say your coursera learning experience compare to your past educational experiences?:  for me, coursera potentially is paradigm changing. i would expect in 10 years time when my daughter who is now seven, i would expect when she get to higher education level, that things like coursera would become a real competitor to formal education. i would expect that to happen in 10 years time.  would you recommend coursera to other people?:  i already recommend coursera to many different people. i got quite a few guys who is doing coursera, different [inaudible 00:19:00] . i have friend who come to me asking me, \"do i need to do a master degree? should i do a master degree?\"because i work in learning and development background, it's my day job and then because i also have quite a long [inaudible 00:19:20] , so sometimes people ask me do they want to do such and such degree. coursera or x is more or less is my first part of core if you just want to learn something, you should do that.  did you take another coursera course for fun?:  at the moment i am taking another [inaudible 00:19:43] university course.  is it the chemistry course?:  no, it's \"a beginner's guide to irrational behavior\" written by professor dan ariely. he is my favorite ted talker. i am just taking that. i just have to take it, i missed it last year. i am doing these two at the same time.the focus on this one, data analysis, this one i really strive to make the best grade as much as possible. the one with irrational behavior, i just am following the memo track, quiz plus exam, even do the different project because i think it's not possible to do also have a day job, and to do this, and also have a family.  take too much time?:  yeah, it really just the time, i wish these two don't [inaudible 00:20:48] the time playing guitar. i tend to get myself over burn, [inaudible 00:20:58] i also follow another subject that's called \"morality\" written by paul bloom from yale university, another ted talker that i like.but that module is closed, it is finished, i am just basically watching one weekly every night before i go to sleep. that's just reading material. at the moment i have at the coursera course that i involve, i have not decided that i would do it. that's to do with guitar, playing guitar.  that would be fun!:  that would be fun. i need to start going to town and decide what kind of guitar i want, or whether actually have the time to do that. one or two machinery module as i say written by dr. andrew ng, that's chinese [inaudible 00:22:17] very difficult [inaudible 00:22:19] . he is the co   founder of coursera.doing the module of machinery, so i signed up for this, but i would probably not do anything at the moment. the course is mid way through and i don't have time to take part, but what i would do is, i would follow up with the video.  you would what, sorry?:  i would follow up with the video.  ok, yeah.:  as it is clear, i really like this way of learning, and i can see it really brings a lot of social value to the society. it is not economic value. i think economic value would be a little bit more difficult to prove, but then of course we are going to question what we apply to here.  do you have any criticisms, of coursera besides us?:  criticism. i am not going to say its criticism. one or two suggestions of course. i think the best suggestion is actually the time spent. because before to sign up the course, there is a [inaudible 00:23:32] to say eight or 10 hours per week. i think also think the participant in the course as i already mention, is probably more than 10 hours [inaudible 00:23:51] .for the people in the forum i am not sure, because we would say 80 percent of the people don't [inaudible 00:23:54] , but for the 20 percent of the people who spend the time on the following thing is more than 10 hours a week. in my case i am probably on 15 to 16 hours per week on this.  i think professor wendell was trying to figure out what the estimate is, and to take everyone's input on that so that you can do it better for the future.:  perhaps make the course a little longer, so just to spread out the time i would say. that's the first thing i can come up with. the second, maybe just set expectation to say this would take a little bit more time. but then of course the downside is then people would choose not to take the course here.yeah, i need to bit a little bit more careful. it would be a shame because this course is really a good course, and i was talking to our friend in the chinese discussion group, and many people actually say this is probably the best course in terms of the priority of the lecture, and the way to teach.  good, we are glad you think so. we spend a lot of time putting together everything.:  you actually take part in putting thing together, right?  the lab and quizzes:  thank you very much for this, that is the third answer, and second i really, really, really, appreciate you do this  has this course affected, and how you feel about statistics in anyway?:  how do i feel about, sorry i don't understand the question?  sorry, has the course affected your perspective of statistics?:  i am not going to say affect, but certainly improve. i didn't really understand that much about statistics, although i touch upon a lot of concept in statistic. first of all, my doctoral study covering three major groups in terms of state of the art.when you do a research you normally cover by the whole thing. this are the big three. one of them machinery, the other one is [inaudible 00:26:33] semantic technology, the third one is called mobile computing.for the first batch of the machinery, anything is built on statistic. i pay with different applicational statistic, but i didn't really go on there really do the application to say what the concept about. doing the course help me to put a big chisel in my [inaudible 00:27:06] if i use these term here.[crosstalk]:  i am also working in production factory industry. we use quite a lot of concept and principle on what we called lean. things like the six sigma, you can say, what sigma means. although, i think in statistic we don't really [inaudible 00:27:38] in physic lab. it really does help. it really does help.  good, that's all the questions that i have. is there anything else you would like me to know? or any question you have?:  one thing about exam i would suggest to be wise a little bit about the metric you use to be given [inaudible 00:29:00] .there is couple of things to say here. on the forum there people already expressing. there is one guy or two guys who submit the answer, the project using the excel spreadsheet using the calculation on the excel spreadsheet  they put the answer on the excel spreadsheet, is that what you say?:  they did their project on the excel spreadsheet. there are one or two guy who are evaluating one or two project was on excel spreadsheet. they didn't use r or use anything, but they got the answer correct.there is obviously, for my personal opinion this kind of project should be fair, but it hard, but metric actually didn't say you can't use it. for me it may be a loophole to tidy up. the other one is some of the scale.you have one two three four five, but for some reason, one and two is there, five is there, three and four is not there. there are one or two questions when i was doing the evaluation, i say all these guys [inaudible 00:29:18] i can't give the mark  we have to look into that then; i am not sure why that is not there.:  i don't know either. yeah, these are the main course and anything else? i am just scratching my head a little bit.  sorry about that.:  not much now, i think that's pretty much it. one of them i would really do appreciate is, you guys participate in the forum a lot. the lecturer itself should also participate [inaudible 00:30:00] , so that is really appreciative. well done, really, well done.  do you participate in any of the facebook group or the google plus?:  not so much on facebook, i am on facebook and i do follow the group, but maybe just me, i don't get involved on facebook discussion. that's just me, and i think there is also a linkedin group, again i don't really use the linkedin group. i think linkedin professional group is more suitable for professional discussion where [inaudible 00:30:42] .  yes.:  again, i can't say a lot. the google community again, unfortunately i don't use it a lot. i tried to join the google hangout and missed the time, because of the time difference. i had a look at the google hangout, a kind of do this little bit chaotic.  sorry, say that again.:  it's a little bit chaotic. [inaudible 00:31:17] but it's nothing to do with the professor, or the [inaudible 00:31:22] so many people out there.  yes. it's difficult to coordinate.:  sometimes the quality of the channel is not very well; i didn't test that one and really didn't pay attention to [inaudible 00:31:36] .  do you have any questions for me or about this research that we're doing?:  not so much on the research. i would be interested to see where there is an opportunity to be [inaudible 00:31:56] of this course. something on the course are not covered. i'm really interested to see that. but the of course this is [inaudible 00:32:07] . i don't expect too much. i [inaudible 00:32:15].  yes. i think it might be something that they're thinking about doing in the future, possibly with a different professor, but we're not sure yet.:  the overall [inaudible 00:32:37] for me is very good, for me it's 10 on 10 mark. i really feel this could be something changing the landscape [inaudible 00:32:52] .  i'm glad you like it. if you have any questions, at anytime you can contact me at the email that i sent you, dookmooks gmail.com. and we'll send you the $20 amazon gift certificate.:  likewise, if you have any other [inaudible 00:33:11] questions you can get in touch with [inaudible 00:33:14] .  ok. thank you so much for your time.:  no problem. thank you for calling.  have a great night.:  thank you. thank you for calling and enjoy your time.  thank you.:  bye bye.  bye.      transcription by castingwords\tS15\tMale\tGraduate\t50000-74999\t35-44\tUnited Kingdom\tEurope\tStat\n",
      "27\tmy name's . i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of the research team for the data analysis and statistical inference course. i'm interested in learning more about        can you hear me? sorry.:  yes, i can.  i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience.in the next 20 minutes, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and some questions about how you feel about coursera courses in general.you can tell me as much or as little as you like, and if you prefer not to answer some of the questions, that's perfectly fine as well.your privacy is very important to me so after this interview is over, i'll remove your name and email address from my notes. this way nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity.your email address will be stored separately. this way, we can use that to email you the $20 amazon gift certificate as a token of gratitude for your participation.just to make sure.:  i'm sorry, i think you're breaking up.  oh, sorry.:  if you could just give me a moment, i'll just try [inaudible 01:13] this and that but [inaudible 01:15] .  ok:  just give me a moment.  ok, no problem.[]:  are you able to hear me now?  oh yeah, can you hear me?:  yes i can.  great, so to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i'd like to audio record our conversation if that's ok with you.:  that's ok. that's no problem.  after my notes and audio recording from our conversation are transcribed, i'll delete the recording.your participation is completely voluntary, so at any point you may choose to stop the interview. your interview will not affect your class performance in any way nor the instructor have any idea whether or not you participated in this research.please feel free to stop me if you have any questions at any point. i want to confirm that your 18 years or older.sorry, i just want to confirm that you're 18 years or older. hello?:  yeah. can you hear me?  yes, now i can hear you. i don't know if you heard this part...:  i'm sorry, did you ask me anything? i don't think i heard you right.  i want to confirm that you're 18 years or older.:  yes, i am.  if you could just tell me a little bit about yourself, what kind of work you do, what you like to do in your spare time, that would be great.:  all right. i work with a retail analytics firm and my designation is general manager of [inaudible 03:34] business development. i manage business development and the shipments for this company for the entire european region.i've worked in business development with startups and technology firms for the past 12 years. in my spare time, i'm an avid cricket player. i play cricket...[crosstalk]  you're an avid what? sorry.:  sorry?[crosstalk]  i didn't hear the last part.:  i play cricket and golf.  ok.:  that's what i like to do in my spare time. i've been taking courses on coursera on and off. i try to do justice to it but somehow i've not been able to complete a course up until now.i travel a lot. [inaudible 04:30] i don't get to spend that one, one and a half hours every week to make sure i complete the courses. i have it in my priority list to complete a bunch of courses this year. that's one of the reasons why i signed up on coursera.  could you tell me a little bit about your academic background?:  i'm a telecom engineer. i completed engineering and communications from the university here and that's my highest degree. i've done a bunch of project management and light courses.i've done an intellectual property law diploma from northern online university and this is as far as what my academic qualifications are, but spent a lot of time...i also took a bunch of courses specifically in a couple of business fields in india around analytics and role of analytics in indian... [inaudible 05:43] . that's my areas of expertise and that's my background.  so what statistics courses have you taken? in the past?:  i am not a statistician, i've never done any course in statistics. this is probably the closest i come to take anything, any course on statistics. in my line of work i have never needed to know statistics.i sell software. i need to understand technological aspects of it, business aspects of it, not necessarily deep dive into how we actually get        i don't need to explain statistics part or mathematics part of it. this is probably the closest i have gone towards attempting anything close to statistics.  what made you decide to enroll in the course?:  curiosity, to begin with. obviously i am able to relate this a lot in my line of work. i am able to understand certain aspects better.i have not completed the statistics part of the course but, i manage to download everything and whenever i have time i scan through videos and course material.this has obviously helped me understand a lot of things which are related to my line of work specifically around data modelling, specifically around predictive analytics, or to basically understand the logic behind it.it's beautiful.  do you plan on using the material you learned at all or use them more just for fun or curiosity?:  it is more for curiosity. my line of work is more selling marketing software. this was purely from personal consumption point of view.i don't think i would dive deep into any of these areas, but this was obviously more like a personal project where it would help me understand this a little bit more.where i can, i'll obviously use this to make others understand as well.  if this course wasn't available is there another way you could learn the material?:  i am not too sure. because, when i was browsing the courses on coursera, this is something that appealed to me and that's one of the reasons why i took this up.i don't think i would have hunted too much outside of coursera to actually go and search for this particular course, because it is there and it was easily accessible. it was a very simple format for me to sign up for the coursein fact i didn't debate initially to sign up for the signature track, but then i realized with my travel commitments i won't be able to do this soon. i do have it on my list to do at least one signature track from coursera this year.  how many hours did you think you spend per week on the course? did you say an hour and a half or two hours?:  probably an hour, an hour and a half, would probably be it, but the last one, one month and a half had been very hectic. i don't think i been able to do even that. i was travelling for almost 20 days in a month.i obviously have downloaded everything on but i will obviously use this. i don't think i have participated actively during the course throughout the program as welli mean my account factors did not allow me to sort of spend time outside of this.  what components of the course did you participate in?:  i think probably just leaf one and leaf two, that's it.  how did you feel about the lectures or the quizzes or the labs that you did see?:  very educating obviously, the format of this rare each [inaudible 10:35] is not more than a certain duration of time. if you don't understand any topic that is being discussed, you can obviously go back to the start and do that over again, again and again until you actually do figure out what they're trying to say.the format is obviously extremely simple. its short burst of videos and class material helps you to sort of understand what is being taught.i think that the ipad app has been a really good thing. until then i had to make sure that i sat down in my study and did this, but now that there is a very good ipad app, it allows me to access the student [inaudible 11:30] .  did you do any of the labs at all?:  no, i did not.  have you had any background at in art in the past at all?:  not really. again my line of work involves working with people who do programming a lot. i am able to link to it a lot more now, based on valuable work that i did do during the course.i was aware of art, all the other vida modelling software and rules that existed because it begin my line of thought. i never attempted to write a piece of code using them, and i don't think that is something that i would be doing in the near future as well.it's good knowledge to know. it's good to understand basic structures and predict lots of art but beyond that, it's something that i don't think i would be interested in to go back.  did you have any interactions with other students in the class?:  no, i did not. that's something that i want to do but it sounds...  too difficult?:  i lived in three different time zones during the last three months, so it was obviously extremely difficult. whatever little time i do get for myself i would like to spent with my family.  if you did have more time would you be interested in forming a study group with your peers, or some sort of community?:  sorry, i missed you on that.  if you did have the time would you be interested in forming a community with your peers or like a study group?:  oh yes, i would definitely do something like that, if time allowed.  and are you taking the course with anyone you know personally?:  no, i'm not.  how would you say your coursera learning experience compares to past educational experiences?:  again, i think this is made of good quality training, education, access to quality instructors across the board, i think it is phenomenal. why people left college, it was obviously limited towards individual students who don't go out and sit in the library or don't go out and seek more information.but with this i think the biggest difference is obviously those factors you get. although i didn't try, but from what i know it's an environment where people from different backgrounds are able to attact. they bring in different perspectives and additional experiences from their own work or their own educational backgrounds.i think that is the biggest project of this school or any other traditional education medium. this i think is probably how education will tip for the next five or ten years, or probably even earlier.  how has the course affected how you feel about statistics in general?:  with all due respect, to people who serve marriage to spend time with so many numbers. [jokingly] you need to have the appetite for it. you need to have skills obviously to understand complex mathematics.sometimes you don't understand why some people are so aloof, because they're so messed up in numbers to actually help. it's like i said it's obviously a lot more respect, that's my first thought.  would you recommend this specific course to anyone that you know?:  yes. in fact i already recommended this course to a bunch of my friends who are, again from completely different backgrounds. people who have backgrounds in music, but were generally interested in learning more about the talents and statistics.i actually have recommended this to a bunch of people, but i'm not too sure if they have signed up. this is definitely something i would recommend.  do you think that you'll take more statistics courses in the future?:  i'm not too sure. i will probably take courses which are more in line to business rather than going deep into statistics.this is an area that interests me. in my line of work i don't think i would be able to spend more than probably half an hour to 45 minutes sitting.i will probably take courses that are a lot more lighter and easier for my own consumption, than something in statistics, which involves not just a short burst of [inaudible 16:56] but also continued work to serve .but if this was eight or ten years back while i was still studying, i would probably be lot more interested in statistics than i am now.  how has this course affected how you feel about coursera? you talked a little about it, but how do you feel about the online   style courses?:  i'm sorry, i missed you again.  it's alright. you talked a little about it, but how has this course affected how you feel about coursera or online   style courses?:  like i said, i think this is probably the way to learn in the next coming years. right from access to good   quality education, to interacting with people from different countries.through having an environment where you learn at your own pace, you decide how much you want to learn. you decide you have the freedom to dig deep into it or limit yourself to just a certain subject. it's completely changed the way people [inaudible 18:07] .  what kind of student would you recommend coursera to?:  access to quality education is something which is still developing. it's a very sensitive topic here in india. because we have so many education institutions, but very few quality institutions that actually allow students to do what they want.they're forced to upon that, \"hey, you have to be an engineer, you have to be a doctor.\" the point is, more and more courses that are coming online, coursera, cole academy, or khan academy, or any of these online platforms.it allows students the freedom to decide what they do want to learn, and what they choose not to learn at that point in time. i think that is the disadvantage that this provides to people from different countries.it's obviously a boon for people living in countries where access to quality education is a challenge. which i think it's filling a massive gap in the entire world right now.  definitely, yes. how likely are you to take another coursera course, either for fun or for work?:  oh, most likely. i've actually signed up for a bunch of courses. i think taking courses is not the problem, because it's obviously the discipline to complete the course lit.  to finish them.:  right, and finish them. which i've still not managed to do. i've been doing courses on coursera for the past one year. i've still not managed to finish an entire course.what i've really done is, whatever courses i've signed up, i look at the course content, download it. there are times where i [inaudible 19:53] through these or i just scan through these.when i'm traveling, when i'm on the flight, whenever i do get the time, whenever i do have the mindset for it, i just flip it open. i think what would help is bringing in some dynamics of participation, which today is obviously, are very one on one.it's very one on one, on coursera. i've done a bunch of courses which i managed to complete on khan academy and cole academy as well. i think the biggest difference here is, there's a lot more engagement with respect to \"one to many.\"one is obviously the peer group, and there's a lot of elements of game theory incorporated, which gives you a certain amount of points. it basically tells you that you've completed a particular milestone.you've reached a milestone where you are probably 50 percent ahead of your peers.some data, which is obviously non   identifiable, which would go out to all the students on a weekly basis, on a fortnightly basis.that says that you are probably in the top three percentile of people who actually completed going through the entire course.some elements of game theory, if it gets incorporated.just for people who take these courses for fun. because they have nothing to lose.  it would give them an incentive.:  exactly. one is incentive. secondly, i think one of the reasons why i wanted to sign up for a signature track was, if i know i have actually signed up for something which i've paid for, i would probably be a lot more serious than i am now, where i don't lose anything.it's good to have additional knowledge, it's good to learn a new thing. if i don't do it, there's no potential loss for me. right?  definitely.:  at the same time, i'd really like the concept of signature courses. i'd definitely take one. i think just for the courses that are there today, which are non   signature tracks, elements of game theory, if it gets incorporated in coursera.some data, non   identifiable data, which is shared amongst all the class and the participants, on a weekly or fortnightly basis.it probably pushes them to do a little bit more than what they're doing now to complete a particular course. it would probably result in better interaction and better quality of the course than the courses taken in .if i could do certain things to change this, i would probably do this.  ok. thank you. have you heard any other criticisms of coursera courses, or do you have any other criticisms? things you would change?:  i wouldn't call this as a criticism, but more as a feedback. i think that is probably a feedback which directly backs the kind of lifestyle i lead. its impact on how i participate in the course. right?  definitely.:  one that obviously made the course really accessible to everyone. the second step is obviously now engagement.if people are not engaged over a bit of time, it'll just result in a lot of people signing up for the course.i don't obviously know any statistics of this, but i'm not too sure how many people actually complete the course, attempt the labs, attempt the exams, or something to [inaudible 23:54] . because i'm not too sure.if it is really low, i don't know what really low would be, probably 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent. it would probably give a little bit more push to people to complete the course if there are additional elements which are engaging.  definitely.:  [inaudible 24:14] , or a weekly basis, or a fortnightly basis. that's just...  sorry, i think you cut out. hello?[telephone dialing][telephone ringing]  hello? sorry, i think you cut out.:  yeah, i think this [inaudible 25:16] . like i was saying, it would probably be a little more exciting for people who get kicks out of [inaudible 25:26] performance.over a bit of time, and not necessarily just the results aspect of it. results are obviously important, that's the end. also the means to the end is how participation...if there are coins, or whatever you want to call, over a bit of time, just for participation. if there's an interactive session with the instructor leading, and just the students from a peer group, and interact with the instructor.or the teaching assistant. this is probably something which would help people sitting on the fence. say, hey, i've just signed up for the course, i don't lose anything if i don't complete it.probably be be a little more participating, and i'm just giving my example. i'm sure there would be many more like myself who would have actively participated in the entire duration of the course. that would make things a lot more interesting.  definitely, yeah.:  [inaudible 26:27] largest grading that would have participation. if there are elements [inaudible 26:34] participation. that is made visible, it will probably make things a little more exciting.  definitely, yeah. we'll definitely take that into consideration for the next time we put the course out. those are all the questions that i have for you. is there anything else you'd like for me to know about the course, or your experience?:  i was curious to understand what this survey is all about. i think it gives me a good understanding of using...if there was a way for me to share feedback.i think it was a good opportunity for me to share feedback of what i've done through the course. i don't think i have any other questions about applications.  sorry, i think you were breaking up a little.:  yeah. i said i don't have any other questions about applications.  ok. if you have any questions at a later time, please feel free to email me at the dukemooks gmail.com. we will send you the $20 amazon gift certificate within the next few days, as a token of our gratitude.thank you so much for your participation. we really appreciate everyone who volunteered for the interviews. we really hope to make the course better in the future.:  all right, thank you so much for your time. nice talking to you.  thank you. have a great day.:  bye bye.  bye.transcription by castingwords\tS16\tMale\tBachelor\t50000-74999\t25-34\tIndia\tAsia\tStat\n",
      "28\tplease tell me about yourself.  if you could tell me a little about yourself. where you're from, what work you like to do, what you like to do in your spare time, that would be great.  i'm from panama. i'm finishing right now my bachelor's degree in electromechanical engineering. i work at panasonic. i do stuff like maintenance of appliances like this.on my spare time, normally i go out do some...play tennis. i like also a lot the pool and billiard, that you're...are you probably...  yeah, billiard.  ..yes, more or less.\t\twhat is your academic background?  could you tell me a little bit about your academic background?  i finished high school, i went to the university. in the electromechanical engineering, you have to take all the calculus, physics, chemistry, all engineering subjects.mainly i take electrical and mechanical engineering classes like electrical science, circuits one, electronics. in the mechanical part also mechanical design, mechanical vibrations, stuff like this. i did an exchange period in italy.i had also some subjects there, more in the computer science area like computer architectures, more or less, that's all.\t\twhat is your background in chemistry statistics specifically?  very nice. so have you had any statistics courses in the past?  yes. i had one but it was not so deep as the one that you are giving in the coursera. it was more like what's mean, what's mode and maybe how the normal distribution works.they maybe had mentioned other distributions, but it was not so...i never had the inference part at least.\t\twhat made you decide to enroll in this course?  what make you decide to enroll in this course?  when i finished my classes in the university, i did an internship. it was mainly doing research in computer tomography. have you heard...  i'm not sure if i know what that is.  it's like when they check your brain to check how it's inside, but doing it with x   rays.  interesting.  i had to manipulate a lot of data. i had to, mainly on the image   processing side. during that time, i noticed that i had maybe a weakness in the data analysis.i had to do a lot of..to seek my criteria, like cutting out liars, and stuff like this. that grew an interest in me of taking such classes.\t\thow do you plan to use the material you learn in this course?   is that how you plan to use the material, to better your data analysis?  yes. if i continue studying, i would like to do some research. i believe it's very important for the research processes.\t\tif this course was not available, is there another way you could learn this material?   if this course wasn't available, is there another way you could learn the material?  you can always grab a book and study, but of course, it's a lot easier if someone that is such a good teacher is giving you the course. that made it better.\t\tso far, how many hours have you spent per week on the course?   so far, how many hours do you think you've spent per week on the course? if you could estimate.  around three hours or less.\t\twhat components of the course do you participate in?   what components of the course do you participate in? the lectures, the quizzes, the labs.  this was the first time that i enrolled as a verified certificate. i was trying to do all everything. like laboratories, exams, everything.\t\thow do you feel about the different components?   how do you feel about the lectures and the quizzes? and all the components?.. hello?  yes.  how did you feel about the different components? the lectures.  the videos were pretty good. i could understand almost everything by watching the videos. i didn't have to do too much after study.  that's good.  i didn't have any background in r, but i knew some math   luck. it was, more or less, very similar, that helped me. it made the laboratories easier.the quizzes were also pretty interesting. you could do it many times. if i couldn't have 100 percent on the first time. i learned a lot.\t\thave you participated in datacamp? or do you use r?  for the labs, did you use data camp or did you use r studio?  data camp.\t\thow do you feel about datacamp?  how did you like data camp?  it was really nice. made the things easier. except for sometimes that it got stuck, and i had to go out and sign again. most of the time, it was working perfectly.\t\thow important is the course to you?  how important would you say the course is to you? getting the certificate?  more than the certificate, the learning is what i was interested in. i signed for the verified certificate because if i was paying the 49 dollars, i knew i would put more...  effort in.  effort. yes.the main reason was i was interested in learning the material.\t\tcan you tell me about your interaction with other students in the class?   do you have any interaction with other students in the class?  not really. i wrote sometimes in the forms, but...very little. almost nothing. no, i couldn't have any other contacts.\t\tare you interested in forming a community with your peers? why or why not?   would you be interested in forming a community with people who you knew? to learn anything.  it depends. normally when i sign for online courses i'm not interested in getting to know more people, but i wouldn't mind if someone asked me to do a study group or something. i won't look for it by myself.\t\thow does your coursera learning experience compare to your past educational experiences?   how do you say the coursera learning experience compares to your past educational experiences?  in here it is a lot better. i can check the media organic i want and you can always repeat the quizzes. you can always do it in you free time whenever you are focused on studying.it's a lot better than going to the class, waiting for the teachers. also in here you have the option to go twice as fast as you will normally hear it. if you are very focused, you can hear it faster and finish earlier.\t\thow has this course affected how you feel about chemistry statistics?  how would you say this course has affected the way you feel about statistics?  it had a good impact. at the beginning i was not interested so much. after i had the research experience problem. i wanted to learn more. now that i had this course i, for sure want to learn even more. it had a great impact.would you recommend this specific course to anyone you know?   would you recommend this specific course to people that you know?  for sure. yes.\t\thow likely are you to take more chemistry statistics classes?   do you think you'll take more statistics courses in the future?  yes.\t\thow has this course affected how you feel about coursera, or other coursera-style courses?   if you had time. how would you say this course has affected how you feel about coursera or online courses?  as i had previous courses in coursera. i already had experience and knew what to expect. this course was above average on my experience of...it was really good. i will continue taking courses in coursera.something that i like about coursera for example, it's compared to udacity for example. in udacity you feel that they are teaching you as if you were a kid, but in here it's not.you have the same education strength as you will in the university or at least i feel like this. the professor would not make the things a lot easier, for you to be able to pass the exam.it may depend on the other professor, but i feel like this.\t\thow likely are you to take another coursera course?   how likely are you to take another coursera course? would you take any for fun or for school or work?  yes. i will continue. right now, i'm enrolled in two more coursera courses. the third one is starting on the 29th and a fourth one is starting three weeks later. i will continue taking courses.  which courses are they?  right now, i'm taking economy policy making and also [foreign words] in italian about relativity's theory. on monday it's the start of economical...something about economics that i'm interested in.later on, the course about music, how to compose music and stuff like this, for fun.\t\thow likely are you to take a coursera course for fun? how likely are you to take a coursera course for school work?   are the other ones for work or for fun?  most of them, for fun.\t\thave you heard of any criticisms of coursera courses? do you have any criticisms? if so, what are they?   have you heard of any criticisms for the coursera courses or do you have any criticisms?  no, not really.\t\tis there anything else you   d like for me to know?   those are the main questions that i have for you. is there anything else you'd like for me to know about the course or your participation? do you have questions for me?

      "29\tif you could tell me a little about yourself        what kind of work you like to do, what you like to do in your spare time        that would be great.  i'm an it professional with 20 plus years of experience in it, doing computer programming, doing project management, also some other tasks like documentation, talking to customers, customer support.the demands of the it business are such that you need to learn, all the time. in the spare time, i try to do some hobbies. i try to get out of life something, but i also need to learn. coursera and other books are another way to improve yourself. unfortunately, you need to sacrifice your leisure also to be able to participate in those courses.  what kind of academic background do you have?  i have the equivalent of a master of science in electronics and telecommunication. i also have a mba degree, done as post   graduate study, basically a master of science.  did you have any background in statistics specifically?  not really, other than the general business training typical for an mba, no background in statistics so far.  what made you decide to enroll in the course?  i'm trying to ride on the wave of big data analytics. a basic statistics course fits very well in that, because it's the foundations of the analysis being done. the rest is algorithms. it fits into the bigger picture of the big data analytics, which is trending in recent years and i hope to benefit from that.  if this course wasn't available, is there another way you could learn the material?  ask again, use a different wording?  sorry. if this course wasn't online, would there be another way you could learn it?  not really, because it would mean enrolling in some alternative university. typically, i wouldn't have time to do that. if i wanted to enroll on duke, it would be completely unreachable because i'm six time zones away, from you.  [laughs] . how many hours would you estimate you spent per week, on the course?  very good question, because many students were complaining [inaudible 04:53] forms that it takes much longer, than two or three hours which were promised.i was not doing that kind of statistics, so i'm not sure. it could have been five hours or even more per week, very approximately. i was not keeping track of my time. i could have, but i didn't need it.  what components of the course do you participate in?  each and every component. also, i watched all the video lectures and read through the slides, through the presentations. afterwards, i prepared for quizzes and for exams. also, i went through all the quizzes, through all the programming, it was called labs.i participated in everything possible, with the exception of the forum which i read, only occasionally. i didn't participate in all the forums. i didn't have time for that, but otherwise i took advantage of each and every piece of the course, and i enjoyed every minute of that.  if you could tell how you felt about the lectures, the quizzes, and the labs.  they were excellent, because they were prepared in a very good way. they were conceptually very mature. they were very well prepared, meaning that the requirements were described precisely, the hints were given clearly.you knew, simply, what you were expected to do and also what was beneficial.the quizzes were very difficult. there was no oversimplification, quite typical on moocs. you needed to prepare very well to take the quizzes. if you failed once, the next quiz would be slightly different.a significant part of the repetition of the quiz contained different questions. it caused a lot of work on the part of the organizers of this mooc to prepare it very well, very difficult, very challenging.i personally could have taken a much more complicated program called scms, because i have a programming background, and they also have our programming background, gained on other different coursera courses.the labs could have been more challenging for me, but they were still very enjoyable and i was very glad to take them. the programming was trivial. it could have been more ambitious for me, personally.  did you use rstudio as opposed to data cam?  kind of. i went through that track. i used r   command   line. it's even a bigger hardcore. not rstudio, but r commands. for me it doesn't matter, because i simply enjoy command   line more.  you said you didn't participate in the forums, but if you had more time, would you be interested in forming the community with your peers?  not necessarily. at the moment i'm not building any online communities or a circle of...i don't even have a profile on linkedin. i hang it to my tutor to set it up. i'm not interested in that kind of networking. i could have participated there.i did it in the past on different coursera courses, in some professional discussions, explaining some things, sending fixes, watching on some other explanations given by other participants, but not to do networking, not to find some ties, some colleagues, not really. i don't need it.  do you know anyone taking the course?  no.  can you tell me how the coursera learning experience, compares to past educational experiences?  i should compare it to coursera, because comparing it to traditional education may be not representative for the sample. these courses were very well prepared and very difficult, which is good, a very positive experience.compared to other courses, there are some courses on coursera which are very badly prepared, and that bad preparation is compensated by significant ease of taking exams, taking tests. in fact, you don't learn that much, you earn the certificate. this statistic wasn't like those courses.you needed to work very hard to earn your degree. this is very positive. i can even compare it to the classics, to \"machine learning\" by andrew ng from stanford university.that machine learning was more programming like. statistical inference is comparable to the best courses on coursera, like machine learning.  i'm glad you've enjoyed it. how important would you say the course is to you? is it more important to get the certificate or to learn material?  i have some significant, doubts about the value of those online certificates. i have little experience, because i'm not very proactively looking for another job.i don't think how these certificates are accepted by prospective employees, particularly if you are not on the page track, but rather, on the anonymous free track, which i am.mostly, it's a matter of gaining knowledge, gaining experience competences, but not the certificate, although it's also very motivating to be above 80 percent, and get the certificate with a distinction. i'm not sure i will be able to allure at it.now you would be because many prospective employees, most likely, are unaware what moocs are and what they mean, and what those certificates are worth of. now, or for some months or years, these certificates are important, but ultimately, i'm not sure if they will be very valuable.  in the next few years they may gain more importance, but for right now, who knows. how has this course affected how you feel about statistics?  i get some very important gut feeling about statistics. i knew and was capable of using some statistical methods, mostly computational methods like linear regression, logistic regression.i knew what standard deviation means, but i didn't have the gut feeling what they are, and didn't have the gut feeling what statistics is all about.i knew nothing about those hypothesis testing tools, about hypothesis and the [bad audio] , i knew nothing about. now, i have a very good gut feeling of what statistics is all about.it's a very good foundation for all the other competencies i already gained, which are, more advanced statistical methods in the direction of machine learning. now, my knowledge, which i already collected, has gained the foundations. previously, it was hanging in the air. now, i've got the foundation.  good. would you recommend the specific course, to anyone that you know?  yes, absolutely. it's terrific. it's worth every minute you spend on it. it costs you some time and effort, but it's worth it. every minute was enjoyable.  are you likely to take more statistics classes now, or more like machine learning?  i need a break now, because i have taken a total of eight moocs...  [in admiration] that's a lot!  ...so far, within the last year, and i need a break now. now it's summer. in summer i have less time, in general, but i reached the point that i was a little exhausted, because i'm working fulltime.also, i have some challenging job which requires quite often more than eight hours a day. if you spend your weekends doing some mooc courses, you end up working 24 7 and it's very challenging. i need some rest.i need to leverage now that knowledge i gained and see if it makes sense, if it helps me, but not jump into more and more courses, because it's simply too exhausting for me.  how has this course affected how you feel about coursera or online moocs?  it moved my opinion in the positive direction because, as i told you already, it's a very good course, unlike many others on coursera and other platforms. woot! increased my opinion on technology. what will come out of that and how it will affect education, is the big mystery for me.i don't know, but i definitely can say for sure that if you pick carefully, you are able to find very ambitious and high profile courses on the coursera, which are the equivalent of traditional education and can be good.also, on coursera there is some crap, we need to pick carefully to find good courses.  after you're done taking a break or whatever, how likely are you to take a coursera course for fun, rather than just for work?  i'm unlikely to do that because, frankly speaking, nowadays i don't have much time to do anything for fun. i'm very unlikely to do that, maybe when i'm retired, in 20 years.  ok. have you heard of any criticisms of coursers courses, or do you have any criticisms?  not about this particular one. in general, yes, some people on the forums confirm my opinion that some courses are not so demanding, and you're able to gain the certificate even with distinction, without devoting that much effort.the useful content is limited and the requirements we should meet are limited. regarding that course statistical interference, i had only heard one complaint which demanded more time than to off two, three hours a week. this is the only complain.otherwise it's absolutely perfect course and something. i enjoy it.  those were all the questions that i had for you, but is there anything else you'd like for me to know about the course, where you're experienced or do you have any questions for me?  well i was wondering, what's the purpose of scientist investing their time and efforts in, preparing those courses?i understand that dr. [inaudible 19:08] , didn't have to prepare all the materials from the beginning, because she already had some online courses distributed, by more traditional means. not mooc.she leveraged the existing material, but it's still a lot of time to compile it, to put it online. what motivates you to do that?  we want to learn the different experience that student online have, because our courses are paired up with the introduction to chemistry course. we're doing a research team for both.we're trying to see how we can measure success for these students, because both of these classes are also taught at duke, in the same exact manner. we want to see the difference in learning and success. we did get a very large grant last year, to put this course online.part of the motivation. mainly the professors enjoys teaching and want to put it online, and reach as many students as possible.  oh i see. [inaudible 20:22] both courses, but you mean that one course is mooc and the other is on duke. but both are statistically inference, or is there another course at duke...[crosstalk]  we have the statistical inference course at duke as well, as an introduction to statistics course. we are also paired up with introduction to chemistry course, that's online right now. because the professors wanted to do this moocs project together. that course is also at duke as well.we're doing similar surveys and experiments for both of them, to compare in class versus online experiences.  ok, i understand, thank you. i have one more question, because i took part in a kind of not so very good course. it was on soft skills, developing innovative ideas for new companies, the first step in entrepreneurship.still, it was course on management soft skills and such it wasn't very difficult to pass. also because i have managerial background. i took it and then it was free. it was on coursera, but then i received the offer to study the complete course.not a single subject, but the equivalent of the degree, which you however could earn completely online. you needed to pay the typical amount of money for education. i believe it might have been like $20,000.you can earn that degree from the university of maryland, college park. you could earn it completely online. are you thinking, about such an offering that some of the complete courses of study can be transferred online beyond, coursera? is it the trend?  at the moment i don't think that's where we're headed, because it takes a lot of time to put these courses online. it wouldn't be able to happen for a while if they did that.also, our statistics department is very [inaudible] . not many people might take that trend as well.  ok. i think this is it.  ok great. we'll send you the $20 amazon gift certificate, within the next week or so. this is a token of our gratitude for your participation. thank you so much for volunteering to participate.  thank you.  if you have any questions at a later time, please feel free to contact me at the duke moocs gmail. i hope you have a great day and thank you so much for your time.  ok, i'm grateful to you, thank you.  no problem. all right, see you.  bye bye.  bye.      transcription by castingwords\tS3\tMale\tGraduate\t20000-34999\t25-34\tFrance\tEurope\tStat\n",
      "30\tgreat. i have a quick spiel to go through before i begin.  ok.  my name is  and i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of the research team for the data analysis and statistical inference course.we're interested in learning more about the coursera student experience. in the next 20 minutes or so, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course and some questions about how you feel about coursera courses in general.you can tell me as much or as little as you like. feel free. if you don't want to answer any of the questions, you don't have to.your privacy is very important to me. after the interview is over, i'll remove your name and email address from my notes. this way, nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity.your email address will be stored separately from...  are you there? i think the connection is...  oh, sorry. can you hear me? hello?  yes. the...[communication interference]  ...broke up a few times.  yeah. i think you're breaking...[communication interference]  let's see how it goes, maybe.  ok.  yeah.  your privacy is very important to us. after the interview is over, i'll remove your name and email address from my notes. this way nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity.your email address will be stored separately, so this way we can use it to email you the $20 amazon gift certificate as a token of our gratitude for your participation. to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i'd like to audio   record our conversation, if that's ok with you.  yes. it's ok.  after my notes and audio   recording from our conversation are transcribed, i'll delete the recording. your participation is completely voluntary, so at any point you may choose to stop the interview. the interview will not affect your class performance.  super.  sorry, did we break up again?  yeah, we did.  your participation is voluntary, so at any point you may choose to stop. and your interview won't affect your class performance in any way, nor does the professor have any idea, if you participated in the research in general.  ok.  i would like to confirm that you're 18 years or older.  yes.  ok. please feel free to ask me any questions throughout this. if you could just tell me about yourself, what kind of work you do, what you like to do in your spare time, that would be great.  in general, i'm a student here in helsinki, finland studying at the aalto university majoring in marketing. i'm in my final year of my master's program. i've decided to take this course to add a quantitative component to my studies which i felt was lacking. i mean my current program. this was my first course that i took at coursera and also my first signature track course.in my free time, i guess the usual things students do...nothing out of the ordinary. i am currently looking for a job and i felt that this course could position it better for a wider range of positions.  if you can go into a little more about your academic background, that would be great. have you had statistics in the past?  yes. i had a few introductory courses. i felt that i took them a few years ago and taking a refresher course would be useful. also, i felt that my previous courses didn't do as good of a job as they could have.  how do you plan to use this material that you are learning or learned?  as far as a future job which could involve some data analysis, for example market research...since i studied marketing, some positions require knowledge of how to use data, how to analyze data, et cetera. i thought that this course would help me be more effective at that.  awesome. if this course wasn't available, is there another way you could learn the material?  yes. i've thought of reading, looking for textbooks and reading through them. obviously that would be a more hands   off approach which would take more time and wasn't as easy, i would say.  do you think you would do it if it was just with textbooks?  if i had to. for example, if i was forced to master some area, i probably would have picked them up. this was an easier instruction to the material which i can do in two months. i could study the material in advance and not wait until i had to learn it, if that makes sense.  how many hours do you think you've spent on the course per week, if you could estimate?  on average 10 to 15 hours.  ok.  two weeks when there was a midterm and a final, i spent more time, maybe 20 hours because i reviewed the materials one more time using the dataspeed two times.  what components of the course do you participate in? the lectures, the quizzes...[crosstalk]  ...the computational track [inaudible 00:06:25] . i participated in all the components. they sent me to forum where i posted only a few times.  how do you feel about the lectures and the quizzes?  the lectures were good. the only drawback was that i felt the teacher spoke quite fast in some of the videos. i had to pause video a lot. i think that caused me to spend more time with it.  what about the quizzes in the labs, how did you feel about those?  i think those were good. i felt that they forced me to go back to the material and understand it better.the labs, it felt, possibly, the material that they added unrelated stuff. stuff that helped me learn to do it better but the labs added more work.there was some [inaudible 00:07:34] was disconnected to the material and what was included in the labs.  did you use datacamp or studio?  i used datacamp.  how did you feel about datacamp?  i liked the format. it was easy to read and implement the instructions. it was challenging to transition them to using r for the project.it was a different feel and different interface. i think it's a good format for someone who hasn't done a lot of programming before.  have you done any programming before?  yes. i have completed a few tracks on codeacademy and treehouse. they're all the basic, tracks for html and css, no actual [inaudible 00:08:35] .  got you. did you ever use any of the statistical applets that were in the lectures or go to the websites?  yes. i used the applet that bennet used. for some reason the applet was very slow on my computer. i wanted the browser, so that was a problem.  i think that has to do with the internet some times. we're trying to work on that to get the higher bandwidth or whatever. how important would you say the course is to you?  quite important. obviously, i don't know what the reaction will be from potential employers but it was 7.5, on a scale of 0 to 10.  ok. is it more important to get the certificate at the end or were you just looking to learn the material?  i think connection broke for a bit.  sorry. were you looking to get the certificate at the end or some students say they were just looking to learn the material.  both learning and getting the certificate was important to me. i'd like to include the course in my linkedin account that i received my certificate.  can you tell me a little bit more about your interaction with other students in the class. you said you posted a few times on the forums.  obviously, every week i looked to the forum, to see what threads were started, where the staff reply. i paid most attention to those threads. i posted only three times, i guess. once to ask a question about the course project, once to ask...i joined the term...about midterm's course and then i asked what kind of accesses are a page, which was the midterm, before taking the final.i guess that's it.  would you be interested in forming a community with your peers, on facebook, google+, or something?  i guess so, but only if i could get some background information on them before. this was one of the challenges using the forum, because some students posted a lot and i couldn't tell if they were writing things that were correct. some students don't post anything on their coursera profile. you can't tell what's their background. i think that's important to know before interacting with them.  are you taking this course with anyone that you know personally?  no.  how would you say your coursera learning experience compares to your past educational experiences?  i think a lot of aspects are the same. to a large extent, i feel that the current format mirrors the online classroom experience to a great extent. we had videos, quizzes, labs. but obviously, the benefits are that i can review the lectures many times if i want. i can then go back to all the questions the students asked and see ways to respond to it.to a great degree, it's very similar to a classroom experience. i feel that there is more room to adapt it to the online environment specifically, if that makes sense.  in what way, do mean adapt it?  one of the things i was thinking about is that there could be more one   on   one interaction between the students and the teacher. a classroom experience, there's always only a few questions that you can take during a lecture or a course. in coursera it's the same. it's only certain threads that get answered and then others have to use up a lot of time to go through...  sorry, i think you broke up a little.  i was saying i would think it would be useful to have a feature where, if you have a question, you can ask someone directly and get a response fast.  did you participate in the google hangout that mina hosted?  no, i didn't, because...  timing.  timing and my usual university course work.  how has this course affected how you feel about statistics?  in a positive way. in the past i wasn't as strong in mathematics as in other subjects. but this course had a positive effect because i understood the material. i did well at the exams. it had a good effect on my studies. statistics.  awesome. would you recommend this course to anyone that you know?  yes, definitely. they were serious about the subjects. i would.  what kind of student do you think would best benefit from it?  someone who is just getting into, or someone who is in the middle of, or completing a more qualitative nature of study, to improve his or her data or mathematics skills.  how likely are you to take more statistics courses?  i would say very likely. only if i would have to do it in my day   to   day work, for example. if not, then i'm not as certain that i would take.  how has this course affected how you feel about coursera or online style courses?  it was a positive experience. i haven't taken any other online courses in coursera or other providers, so i can't compare. if other courses have a simpler format and structure, i would be willing to take them because i like this format overall. it's an effective way of learning and teaching.  how likely are you to take another coursera course, for fun, school, or work?  you broke up there for a second.  sorry. how likely are you to take another coursera course, either for fun, school, or work?  quite likely. i was looking into the computational track. i can't remember from which university. the only downside is that they're timed. when i was doing this course, the other track started. i hadn't been there, so this course ended and that track began.i probably would have looked into starting another course, but since there was an overlap in timing, i have to wait until the next course is on again.  you can't go and do it now, or is it too late?  it's too late to start. the course has been running for a month, two to three weeks.  ok. have you heard of any criticisms of coursera courses, or do you have any criticisms of the style of course?  haven't heard any mean criticisms, only on maybe facebook pages. i'm afraid how the students write, and also there is a wide range of comments there. me, personally, the forum is a bit challenging to navigate, takes up lot of time to go through each thread and pick out the useful things. [inaudible 00:18:14] huge amounts of information there. it takes more time than going to the videos.then the peer assessment aspect of the course is also quite challenging. in the sense that there was a lot of variation in quality and it was challenging to grade the papers because you had to choose from two or three criteria, like get this point, get this. there was a huge variation in the [inaudible 00:18:49] sometimes i couldn't match the point to what was given in the...  in the [inaudible 00:18:57] ?  yeah.  ok. how do you think we could change that in the future, or would you have any suggestions?  i think the forum format is an old format and it's hard to change it. maybe sort the questions where the staff replies from those where the staff hasn't replied yet. we could access one or the other, instead of going from top to bottom and seeing where the staff replied. late lists for one thing.maybe we'll get a long thread. there is a lot of serious participating. maybe separate the initial question and the course instructor's final reply. maybe they could place it at the top or separate them with a different color so you can see the question and the answer. then going to the other student responses only if you want to.  i think there might be coursera format in general, but we can definitely try and change that.  yeah.  those are all the questions that i have for you. is there anything else you would like for me to know or any suggestions for the course, or any questions that you have for me?  obviously i'm finished the course. i am wondering what are courses i could take that would compliment this one especially regarding the content. i don't want to take any courses which have overlap in the material. but i also don't want to take the course which is too advanced where i wouldn't be able to transition smoothly to the course.maybe have a final message saying, \"if you are interested in learning more, here are the resources that you could look into.\" and have it come from the teacher who knows the material quite well. then i could trust her recommendations.  i am not sure if we will be doing more courses in the future. we are trying to figure that out, if we are going to do a next course. it takes a long time to plan them and put them together. i will definitely talk to mina about sending something out about what other tracks there after this and let you know.i know there definitely are other 66 courses online on coursera right now or that are starting soon. i am not entirely sure of their material.  to the other points. one was regarding the [inaudible 00:21:53] statistics book. i will say there was the option of doing extra assignments after each module. i felt that i needed more practice. my system was new. there was no answer to those questions or no way to check your work.i felt that even if i did them i won't even know if i got them right since there was no feedback mechanism. that part could be improved somehow, or we just add more courses, which wouldn't be graded but tell you, this is where you got right, this is where you got wrong.  i think there might be answers at the back of the book. you could definitely, in the future, post in the forums or we can have posts about all the open intro questions. i'm sure there is a solutions guide somewhere. definitely something to look into.  generally, it was more practice before the exams. this is what i felt that i needed more.  you said you had a third point?  it was more practice before the exams. especially, before the final. i reread lectures. i felt there was more quiz style practice that i could take. i would have definably used that option.  we'll definitely look into that, doing more practice quizzes or a practice midterm or final that people could do. do you have any questions for me or anything else?  that's most of it.  thank you so much for participating in our research. we will send you the $20 amazon gift certificate within the next few days or so. if you have any questions at a later time, please feel free to contact me at the dukemooks gmail.com email. i check that regularly so you can definitely ask any questions. thank you so much for your time.  thanks.  have a great day.  thanks, you too.  bye.  bye.      transcription by castingwords\tS4\tMale\tBachelor\t<20000\t18-24\tFinland\tEurope\tStat\n",
      "31\tin the next, about 20 minutes, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course and some questions about how you feel about coursera courses in general.you can tell me as much or as little as you'd like. if you prefer not to answer some of the question, that's perfectly fine as well.your privacy is very important to me. after this interview is over, i'll remove your name and email address from my notes. this way, nobody who reads my research will have access to that information on your identity. your email address will be stored separately        oh, that was weird. sorry.your email address will be stored separately from my notes and the transcript of your interview, and used to email you the $20 amazon gift certificate as a token of gratitude for your participation.  ok.  to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i'd like to audio record our conversation, if that's ok with you.  that's fine.  after my notes and the audio recording from our conversation are transcribed, i'll delete the recording.  ok. is the quality good?  yes. it's perfect.  ok.  your participation is completely voluntary, so at any point, you may choose to stop. it won't affect your class performance, nor does the instructor know whether or not you participated in the research at all.  ok.  i just want to confirm that you're 18 years or older.  yes.  if you could just tell me a little bit about yourself, what kind of work you do, what do you like to do in your spare time, that'd be great?  i'm a graduate student at north carolina state university in microbiology. i research bacteria, biofuels related. i've taken some statistics at nc state and other courses online. in my spare time, i like gardening        are you still there?  yes.  and fermented foods. i have a podcast about bacteria to spread research to the public.  that's interesting. cool.  it's called \"bacteria files\".  i'll have to check it out. [laughs]  thanks. anything else?  yes, that's about it. can you tell me little bit more about your academic background?  i got my undergrad in biology, specialization microbiology at cornell university. i worked in a lab there for a few years before coming to grad school here.  what kind of statistics courses have you taken?  at nc state, i took a biological sciences experiment, the second semester class of that. on coursera, i've taken some statistics from john hopkins' classes, \"statistics one\" from princeton and the \"data analysis and computing for data analysis for using r\".  cool. what made you decide to enrol in this course?  it seems like every time i take statistics what i learn sticks with me for a little while and then i kind of forget it. i figure, the more times i learn it in a different way, the more likely it is to stick with me for longer.  got you. how do you plan to use this material, if at all?  for my own research sometimes or in the future, maybe in a career. i'm not sure. it's useful in general, i think, evaluating claims of evidence and stuff.  it just helps with logic, i think, as well. how many hours do you estimate that you've spent on the course per week, if you could estimate?  i'd say at least two hours a week.  what component of the course do you participate in?  i watched the lectures and i do the quizzes and i did the project and the exams.  you didn't do the labs?  yes, the labs too.  how do you feel about the lectures and the quizzes...?  they were very good, explained in a very clear way. the quizzes, i thought sometimes, at least at first, i wasn't sure what was being asked. i don't really have a good example of that though to tell you, but that was an impression i had. it was kind of frustrating.  as time went on, did that get better?  yes, i think it was just the first couple that were like that.  what about the labs? did you think they helped with learning the material?  i think so.  did you use data   camp?  i used r.  how did you find r? you said you took a class on it before.  yes, i've taken some, so it was a good review. i had to relearn some things with that too. i like r. it's cool.  how important would you say the course is to you? were you taking it more of just to learn or do you want...  of the ones that i've taken, it was definitely among the best.  we're glad you liked it.  yes        important. i think it's very good. i would look back to it in the future for reference, especially regarding conditions for tests, assumptions.  are you doing it to get the certificate or is it more important to just learn the material, would you say?  i'd say the certificate matters a little. i would want to get it. but if it didn't include one, then i would take it anyway just for the material.  have you had any interactions with other students in the class?  no. i don't really use the forms on coursera much.  would you be interested in forming a community like on facebook or google plus, if you had time?  i'm not sure. i guess not really.  do you know anyone taking the class with you?  no.  how do you say this coursera learning experience compares to pass educational experience?  it's definitely not as much motivation because it's not graded or it goes on a permanent record or anything compared to the university class.i don't put in quite as much time as i would to learn it thoroughly and make sure i was doing well. i guess it doesn't go in as much depth as my class did, but it was more introductory than that.  what about the online aspect? how did you find that?  i like the flexibility of that.  how has this course affected how you feel about statistics in general?  it's made me more comfortable for the moment, i guess. it explains things well. i think i would be more comfortable in the future, have a better grasp of it.  would you recommend this specific course to anyone that you know?  yes, definitely        anyone who's interested. it was one of the better ones on coursera, as i said.  do you plan on taking more statistics courses in the future?  i think so, if they're available. i'm signed up for \"mathematical biostatistics boot camp two,\" john hopkins.  how has this course affected how you feel about coursera or online   style courses?  i think the first half of the question cut out.  i'm sorry. how has this course affected how you feel about coursera or other online   style courses?  it's hasn't really. i've taken a bunch of coursera classes, so i'm pretty fond of them.  how likely are you to take a coursera course for fun rather than just for school or work?  at least half of the ones that i take are for fun.  what kind of classes are they?  i took one called \"a brief history of human kind\". that was really fun.  that sounds interesting.  i took one called \"the science of gastronomy\". it was about cooking and food and some others.  have you heard of any criticisms of coursera courses or do you have any criticisms?  i guess i've heard that they might take away from university        people going there.  how valid do you think that is?  i think the university on   campus, can have a lot of things that the online experience doesn't really provide. at least, at the moment, the online is a lot cheaper obviously.  definitely. do you have any criticisms of coursera courses?  in general?  yes. or of this course, any criticisms?  not of this course other than what i said about the quizzes being difficult.in general, i guess there could be some ways to make the certificates more meaningful, if that is a desire, making it more difficult to cheat or something, or just keep taking the quiz until you get it all right.  yes, some courses will let you do that and they just don't change the questions.  yes.  do you think if they required the signature paths that would make the certificate more meaningful?  i think the certificate signature thing is good for people who want a more legitimate certificate. i haven't done that, so i don't know if it is harder to get a certificate in that way.  i'm not sure. i think it's just...  it's just a matter of the design of how many times you can take the quiz or if there's new questions every time, stuff like that.  definitely. those are actually all the questions that i have for you. is there anything you'd like for me to know or any questions that you have?  i don't think so.  thank you so much for your time. we'll be sending you the $20 amazon gift certificate to your email in the next week or so, so you can look forward to that. if you have any questions at a later time, please feel free to contact me at that dukelukes gmail.com email.  ok.  thank you so much for your time. we really appreciate...  sure.  ...you volunteering.  thanks.  have a great day.  you too.  thanks. bye.  bye.      transcription by castingwords\tS5\tMale\tBachelor\t50000-74999\t25-34\tUnited States\tAmerica\tStat\n",
      "32\thello.  hello.  hi, can you hear me?  i can hear you, but i can't see you.  yeah, i have my video turned off.  oh, yeah.  how are you?  i'm ok.  i just have a little spiel to go through, before we start.my name's  and i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of the research team for the data analysis and statistical inference course. i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience.in the next 20 minutes, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and some questions about how you feel about coursera courses in general.you can tell me as much or as little as you like, and if you prefer not to answer some questions, that's perfectly fine as well.  yes. ok. that's good.  your privacy is very important to me, so after the interview's over i'll remove your name and email address from my notes. this way nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity.your email address will be stored separately from my notes so that we can use it to email you the $20 amazon gift certificate as a token of our gratitude for your participation. to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i would like to audio   record our conversation, if that's ok with you.  yes, that's fine.  after my notes and the audio recording from the conversation are transcribed, i'll delete the recording. your participation is completely voluntary, so at any point you can choose to stop, and it won't affect your participation in any way in the class. i also want to confirm that you're 18 years or older.  yes.  if you could just tell me a little about yourself, what kind of work you do. what do you like to do in your spare time? that would be great.  yes, i missed your name. is it [inaudible 02:27] ? call me [inaudible 02:28]. , is it?  yes, it's , sorry.  ok. i'm a civil engineer. i'm from ireland, originally.  to rephrase.  [inaudible 02:43] a whole lot of different plants here based of morogoro in tanzania.  sorry, could you repeat that. i think we froze a little.  yes. i'm a civil engineer from ireland        irish civil engineer, and i'm working in tanzania at the moment, supervising a water supply project.  how very nice. what kind of things...  did you get that?  yes. what kind of things do you like to do in you spare time?[pause]  sorry. could you hear me?  no. i'll turn of video, might help.  ok. is that better?  yes. that might be better now.  what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time if you have any extra time?  in my spare time, i play a bit of tennis, swimming, and my family is out here. i've got three children. they take up a lot of spare time. also in the last year or less than a year, i'm doing these coursera courses online. that's pretty much my spare time.  what is your academic background?  i have a bachelor degree in engineering from the university college dublin and i have a masters degree in water and environmental engineering also from university college dublin.  have you had any statistics courses in the past?[pause]  what would you say is your background in statistics specifically if you had any?  sorry.  have you had any past experience with statistics specifically?  past experience with?  statistics.  no, not really. i would say when i was in the university, mathematics was my strongest subject but not particularly statistics or probability for some reason. it was never my top area. i had an interest [inaudible 05:36] .  what made you decide to enroll on the course?  i had a colleague, a former colleague of mine that i used to work with. i noticed on linkedin that he had done a masters in business analytics in dublin, i just emailed him myself, \"what's that all about\"? i had never even heard of analytics before and he told me he was up to more or less changing his career.he suggested checking out coursera. that's how i started looking at the online courses.  how do you plan on using this specific course material?  i'm not too sure. i am considering...  sorry, i think you cut out.  i was going to do masters in mathematical modeling in university of limerick in ireland which i think is similar possibly. i'm actually not sure how similar mathematical modeling course would be to a statistics or inference, whatever.  it probably be pretty simple.  yeah, once again because i'm nearly finished here, i'm thinking about doing that course when i go back, after that who knows, because things have changed in the last three years, three   and   a   half years in the whole area of data. i think it's a very new area, isn't it?  hmm, definitely. if this course wasn't available is there another way you could learn the material?  if it wasn't available?  yes  i have done a course from  hopkins. it's bio   statistics which is similar, i passed the course but i was a bit lost in this        in the whole thing about the inference and all that. when i started doing this one, a lot of it became material to me.the combination of the fact that i think the one and this one can do it because it is a very good course and also the fact that i had done something similar one public previously even thought i struggled at it, it certainly helped.  definitely. so far, how many hours do you think you've spent for a week on the course?  i spend about, i spoke with the project now and everything, i might be up around 10 hours a week. it's pretty big. i'm trying this one.  yeah, there is a lot of videos sometimes. what components of the course do you participate in?  i'm participating in everything.  ok. how do you feel about the lectures, the quizzes and the laboratories and the project?  it is all very good. i think the labs are brilliant because i made up my mind that i wanted to learn r, as well but i thought i might have to do a separate course on r, but i've learnt a lot about r from those laboratories.  good. did you use datacamp at all?  yes. i did all of those.  what about the lectures and the quizzes? do you think they were helpful?  yes, excellent. the lectures were very good. they were done very well, started at the right place, and went at a good pace.  have you had any interaction with other students in the class?  no. that's the one thing that i haven't done. i'm not too sure. i'm not really involved in the discussion forums. i read them a lot but i don't contribute. i'm not really sure why not. i think that i'd like to start doing something like that. i don't know why i'm not doing it.  would you be interested in forming a community with your peers, like a google+ or facebook?  yes. i'm not... [audio gap] contributing. yeah, the discussion forums are good.  how does your coursera learning experience compare to past educational experiences?  it's very good. i can see that it's a big leap in the whole education, this moocs. the standard is very good compared to...i did one of them for stanford. it was called \"introduction to mathematical thinking.\" the professor was lecturing 250 students, he said, \"you don't have at last, and you just have an audience.\" that was my experience.when i started off university i was in a class of 250 people. the amount to learn in that is not great. it's not really the way to do that. this is very...you're learning all the time, in these courses, they're good.  would you recommend coursera to other people?  yes, i have done. it is a lot of word of mouth with coursera, i think.  are there any courses that you'd be interested in taking for fun, or others for school or work?  for fun on coursera? no, i haven't seen any that are actually...but i wouldn't have time anyways.  how has this course affected how you feel about statistics?  it's got me over a hum with statistics. i've read that a lot of people who were very good at math have struggled a little bit with probability and statistics. i think i've gotten over that now and it's definitely made a big difference.  would you recommend this specific course to other people?  i would.  have you heard of any criticisms of coursera, or do you have any criticisms of it?  [audio gap] ...maybe at hand.  those are, actually, all the questions that i have for you. is there anything you'd like me to know about the course and your experience?  no. i'm almost finished. i suppose my team would be really...what's any recommendations about what to do next. i only heard about this whole area of data analysis, data science about a year ago. i'm just wondering how much education you would need, how much of this you would need, before you could call yourself, i'm not even sure what you call yourself, a data scientist or an analytics person.  what they tell me in college is that, usually, people go out to get their phds or masters. because it's so new, a lot of companies are looking for people who know the computer science aspect and the statistics aspect, and they're willing to teach you. or, at least, that's what i found in my experience. i guess it depends. a lot of it is on how much programming you know, and that's definitely a big part of it.  if you can go to them and say, \"i know how to program in r or matlab, or whatever,\" that's a big plus.  definitely.  then, they'll teach you, the rest of it you'll learn on the job.  i think that's a lot of it. i've taken many other statistics courses as well, so i think just having a foundation in statistics and knowing how to do critical thinking is, definitely, very helpful.  my colleagues now, he is actually working, he is irish but his wife is american so he's working somewhere in america. he says he is working for a smart metering company. i emailed him, actually when i was doing the job hopkins, i said i was struggling with things like inference and hypothesis testing...[audio cuts]  sorry, i think you cut out. hello?  ...that much in his job, but i suppose maybe every job is different.  i think it depends on the job because a lot of times you are not necessarily doing statistical inference you are just doing consulting or just looking and analyzing data.  yeah, what i am getting from to is that collecting the data, getting the raw data, and asking the right questions is very important in his job.  definitely, because once you have the data in a nice format it is not that difficult. but getting the data into that format is what's the hard part.  yeah. what are the important packages that mostly are r and matlab a good one to have as well?  a lot of economic companies use sas or spss, i have never used matlab so i am not necessarily sure but i think a lot of companies are starting to use r now. some still don't know what it is because it is relatively new.  mostly r and he says he is using excel a lot on his job too.  if you could work with excel and use all those functions that's definitely a plus, as well.  it's an area that i am learning about but i am also finding out that it's actually being used in my own industry so that's interesting too. i just noticed companies such as ibm are doing a lot of on water project they call the smart cities thing which is to do a lot of overlaps with civil engineering and they seem to be using dsl.[crosstalk]  it is definitely becoming one of the newest things i think because everyone needs to store their data and figure out what is the best option in the future.  how long have you been doing, you took phd there or are you? duke.  i am an undergraduate. i have a year and a half left.[audio cuts]  sorry, did you hear that?  hello?  hello?  i can hear you now.  i am an undergraduate at duke, i have about a year left.  all right. you are doing in data, the courses?  i am statistics and computer science, combining the two.  you are on the right area for all the huge amount of opportunities, i presume.  hopefully, that's my goal for when i graduate.  i cannot think of any other questions i have.  ok, great. we will email you the gift certificate within the next week or so. to email that i will contact you before and if you have any questions at a later time, please feel free to contact me at the dukemoocs gmail.com email. i hope you enjoy the rest of the course. thank you so much for participating and helping us out.  hello? we got cut off there.  sorry, you'll get the $20 amazon gift certificate within the next week or so and if you have any questions at a later time please feel free to contact me at the dukemoocs gmail.com.thank you so much for your participation, we really appreciate all the feedbacks so that we can make the course experience for students better.  just one more question, is there anything new you want to plan that are already on coursera?  at this time we are just doing this one course but we are trying to figure out courses in the future, as of right now not yet, but hopefully, within the next year.thank you again for taking the time out here today.  thank you, , and best of luck with your degree.  thank you. good luck with the rest of the course.  ok. thanks.  thanks. have a great day.  bye.  bye.      transcription by castingwords\tS6\tMale\tBachelor\t100000+\t45-54\tTanzania\tAfrica\tStat\n",
      "33\t...being with us for this interview, i just have a little spiel.  no problem, go for it!  my name is . i'm an undergraduate student at duke university in the united states. i'm part of the research team for the data analysis and statistical inference course. i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience.in the next 20 or 30 minutes, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and some questions about how you feel about coursera courses in general.you can tell me as much or as little as you like. if you prefer not to answer some of the questions, that's perfectly fine. your privacy is completely important to me, so after this interview is over, i'll remove your name...  i'm sorry, you cut out.  oh, i'm sorry.  oh, there you are, ok.  ok. can you hear me?  yes.  i don't know what the last thing you heard was.  your privacy.[laughter]  once the interview is over, i'll remove your name and email address from my notes. this way nobody who reads the research will have access to your information on your identity.your email address will be stored separately so that we can send you the $20 amazon gift card, as a token of our gratitude for your participation.  yes, no problem.  just to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me...  oh, you cut out again.  i'm sorry.  are you there?  that's annoying.  sorry. is it me?  my computer is probably going a little crazy right now.  i'm not worried.  just to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i would like to audio record our conversation. if that's ok?  yes, not a problem.  then, after my notes and the audio recording are transcribed, i'll delete the recording. your participation is completely voluntary, and you may choose to stop at any point. your interview will not affect your class performance in any way.  sounds good.  i just want to confirm that you're 18 years or older.  yes.  ok, great. if you could just tell me a little about yourself, what kind of work you do, what you do in your spare time that would be great.  oh, you cut out again, sorry.  sorry.  can you hear me?  yes.  ok, there you are. i went to american university in dc. my undergrad was in international studies and i did a minor in economics. but, i had previously not taken statistics while doing that degree. currently i'm working in afghanistan on a us aid funded project.i was a program information manager, so i wanted to see what else was out there.one of my friends who's taken coursera courses before, she recommended that i sign up for this course. she's taking it as well. she said, \"why don't you just try it? you've never taken statistics before.\" it's been really enjoyable so far. i've really liked it.  have you guys been studying together?  no, she's a little competitive, [laughs] so we don't study together.  got you.  we also live on different compounds, so she lives across the city. we only see each other once or twice a week.  you didn't have much statistics background before?  no, none. i kind of opted out of it, i guess? i didn't have to take statistics in my undergrad, so i never had the chance. when this course came up and my friend recommended it, i said, \"ok, here's my chance to see what i missed in college, what everyone was complaining about.\"  how do you plan on using that material that you've learned in this course, if you planned on using it?  i'm hoping to eventually finish the entire specialization, because i'm on signature track right now.i'm starting an online master's program, through the university of york, a master's in public administration. i'm hoping to use some of the tools that i've learned in this course and future courses, to contribute to my work on that master's degree.  if this course wasn't available, was there another way you could learn the material?  i've seen some other open source, online statistics courses, but probably if my friend hadn't recommended that i look at coursera, if she hadn't specifically recommended this course and specialization, i might not have actually gone to it.i wasn't actively, really looking, it was just something that came up, and i said, \"oh that would be beneficial.\" so i went for it.  so far, if you could estimate, how many hours have you spent per week in the course?  in the beginning, i wasn't really sure how to study for it, because i've been out of school for a few years. i was just using the lectures, using that to study before taking the quiz. and i was doing ok on the quizzes, but i wasn't doing as well as i'd liked.i started supplementing just watching the lectures and taking notes, with reading the relevant text section first, then the relevant videos, and having all of my notes, going through the learning objectives. i type out all of those and keep my notes that way.since i started doing that, i've gotten like 100 on almost all the quizzes. they have become a lot easier.i think because i didn't have any background i needed to read the text, because i've just provided the baseline like, \"ok, now i understand what we're talking about.\" the video reinforced the textbook material. then the quizzes just became a lot easier since i started doing that.  what components of the course do you participate in?  i watch all the lecture videos. i read the text book. i've taken all the quizzes. i've done all of the labs.i started the labs with datacamp, but i really didn't like it. the console kept freezing, and sometimes it would say that every answer i put in was wrong. or i'd put things in the console and it would give me error messages, or it would say it wasn't correct.then i would look at the solution and what i put in was exactly what the solution was. i got a little frustrated with datacamp. i think it was helpful to kind of get the hang of things, but i switched over.  you switched to r afterwards? can you hear me?[pause]  sorry, can you hear me?  i was just typing and i think my internet connection might have just wavered for a moment. i don't know...where did it cut off?  datacamp?  ok, just not really loving datacamp. i used it in the beginning to get the hang of things, but i kept getting error messages when i was putting things in correctly. or i would select an answer and it would say it was wrong, and i'd select the other ones and it would eventually say all of the answers were wrong.  that was frustrating.  the console would freeze and it would give me the little circle of death [chuckles] .  the circle?  the circle of death, the little circle that just keeps going around. it's like \"hmm, hmm. no, it's not going to do anything.\"i switched over to rstudio. i think it would better start using rstudio from the beginning. i want to maybe look at some other kind of intro to r, and rstudio stuff after this, because i think i could take it a little slower and go through it.piece by piece it would help reinforce it, because i've never done any kind of programming or studied any other programming languages before. it was all brand new for me.in addition, i did the project. i'm waiting for my score back tomorrow, which i hope is good. i'm just studying for the final now.  do you think that datacamp helped you learn the syntax for r better? or do you think it would have been more beneficial just to start with r?  i wish i just started with r, because it made it more confusing for me. i got a little frustrated with datacamp at the beginning, which affected my experience with learning r. i think just using the pdf step by step, using rstudio would have probably been a better way for me to go.  how you did you feel about the lectures and the quizzes? do you think that they helped you learn?  definitely. the lectures are really good for me reading the text, and then watching the lectures. it was the perfect combination for me to really get a grasp of it.the quizzes were all very fairly done. i think i used all of the attempts on all of them, because i was like, \"no, i need to get the highest score i can.\"i took three times for everything, but i think the quizzes and the lectures are really good. mid   term i didn't do as well as i'd liked, because i hadn't really started reading the text book and watching the lectures yet. i was still a little shaky on some stuff, but i did ok.as long as i do decently on the final, i'm anticipating getting the certificate with distinction, so i'm keeping up the [inaudible 09:35] cost.  can you tell me about your interaction with other students in the class if you have any or not?  i did not really participate in the discussion forums much, but i've definitely gone through and read the feeds and looked for stuff that was more helpful for me. but in general, everyone seems pretty engaged.there seems to be a lot of different levels from people who are very basic knowledge. from people like me, where i've got my degree but haven't specifically studied statistics, to people who seem to use it in a professional capacity but are using pretty advanced methods.it's a really nice big mix of people taking the course.  would you be interested in forming any community with your peers on google plus, or facebook, or anything? is it just easier to do it on your own, i guess?  i'm sorry. you cut out there at the beginning. what did you say before google plus?  i'm sorry. would you be interested in forming any community with the other students on google plus or facebook...  yes. i would definitely join a group and contribute to discussions and stuff like that. i think for the discussion forum stuff, i used it as a resource tool for me to see what other people were talking about, then for me to ask questions because i didn't really have very many specific questions to ask.yes, definitely.  how does your coursera learning experience compare to past educational experiences?  i'm sorry. did you cut out?  sorry. how did you say your coursera learning experience compares to past learning experiences?  this is my first online course that i've ever taken. i'm just extremely impressed and i'm kind of worried that other online courses i take in the future are just not going to meet up to these expectations that i have now after doing coursera.from the lectures, all the materials and additional resources that are available on the site, to the quizzes, the mid   term, everything was just really well   structured...the project.even just reading the discussion forums, people are raving about this course and about how well it is done. i'm kind of worried about starting my online master's program and not being as impressed and paying a lot more money.  we're glad you liked the course. have you looked in to any other coursera courses? would you take any for fun, or school, or work?  definitely. i've kind of looked and seen what else was out there. i know johns hopkins was also doing a data science specialization. i looked into that.my friend here also looked into that. she said she started it and it was just        she actually stopped. she was like, \"i'm not going to go for the certificate unless maybe i'll take one or two for fun.\" she said it's very basic. she said this coursera course, the duke university one, is a challenge for her.she was an econ major. she had done econometrics. she has done all of that regression and stuff like that. she said this course was a lot better and better well   done. that doesn't make any sense, does it? it was very well   done.she tried the data science one from john hopkins which was supposed to be really good. she wasn't very impressed.i'm definitely going to look at the two other specializations courses. the composition and then the reasoning and logic, i can hopefully take over the next six months to a year.  how has this course affected how you feel about statistics?  oh, you cut out.  sorry.  are you there?  how has this course affected how you feel about statistics?  i previously didn't really have any background on it. i just remember other people at college complaining mostly about statistics courses, and studying like crazy, and not doing very well in exams.  [laughs] basically.  maybe i have more time to commit here because taking this course and working in afghanistan. there's not much else to do.i'm attracted to the science now. i think it's interesting. i would like to do some more advanced courses in it, go into an intermediate level.  would you recommend this specific course to other people that you know?  my friend and i already have. people will come over and we sit there chatting back and forth about this course, talking about people on the discussion forum and about the lectures. people just stare at us like we're crazy.definitely. i've talked about it. i've already recommended it to a couple of people. i send them the link and say, \"you should check out the next start date for this course. it's really worth your time.\"  have you heard any criticisms of coursera courses? do you have any criticisms of it?  this is my first one. i don't really have any general criticisms. the only thing that i get worried about, just because where i am, is that the internet connection can sometimes get cut off.i start sweating when i take the mid   term and finals, because i'm like \"oh, no. what is my internet connection fails for just a moment and i somehow lose my test spell.\" there's not really any way to solve that. i understand that has to be one time. you can't have three attempts at a final exam.it's not really a criticism, just kind of a worry of mine that something is going to happen, and then all of the hard work i put in won't result in achieving the certificate. i keep my fingers crossed that nothing catastrophic happens when i take it.  yes, hopefully. did you use any of the applets that were in the lectures?  yes. i like to the different distribution calculators and things like that. i think having the tables and the distribution applet        are available to use to calculate the different things is definitely helpful.  those are all of the questions that i have for you. do you have anything else that you'd like for me to know about the course or your opinions?  i think i was about to answer your question about exactly how much time i spent every week. i'm trying to think.it depends on how many lectures. i guess i would have to say at least 6 hours        probably between 6 and 10, depending on the project, a little bit more. when the mid   term was there, definitely a little bit more.i've seen some conversations on the discussion forums about people saying that the estimated time was way too high and that they only spend two hours. i'm just like, \"yeah. ok, whatever.\" i needed to spend that whole 6 to 10 hours to really get a handle for it.maybe the only thing would be, in the marketing of this course, for beginners who have no previous statistics experience, you can expect to spend the full allotted 6 to 10 hours, and maybe a few more per week over those with some background in statistics        it probably comes a lot easier.i know my friend, since she has background in it, only spends maybe two or three hours a week, where as i have to spend at least double.  there's a lot of lecture videos so it makes sense.  yes, i know. some people watch it on 1.5 speed. i'm like \"no, no, no. i need to watch at normal speed and take notes, and sometimes pause it, and write down some extra notes.yes, everything is good. i'm really happy with the experience so far.  we're glad that you are happy with it. that's all the questions that i have. do you have any questions for me?  i think i'm good. just keep up the good work. i know you and your other staff members, and the professor are really responsive on the discussion forums        is really helpful. i think everybody has noticed that and is mentioning and commenting on that.  thank you. we'll send you...  you there?  sorry. can you hear me?  oh, there you are.  we'll send you an email with the $20 amazon gift certificate probably in the next week or so. i think we're going to wait until the end of all the interviews so we can just send them all out at once.if you have any questions, feel free to contact me. other than that, i think we're good.  well, happy easter! i can't believe you're taking time out on easter to do these.  it's finals, almost. got to get everything done.  nice.  thank you, happy easter to you as well.  [inaudible 18:25] .  all right. have a great day. thank you so much for your participation.  are you there? sorry, i think you cut out.  sorry. have a great day and thank you so much for your participation. we really appreciate it.  not a problem.  see you.  bye.      transcription by castingwords\tS7\tFemale\tBachelor\t50000-74999\t25-34\tAfghanistan\tAsia\tStat\n",
      "34\ti can hear you, what about me? can you hear me?  yes. sorry for being a few minutes late. my computer has been going crazy.  ok.  i have a quick spiel to go through before we begin. my name's ...  hello.  hello.  ok, i can hear you.  my name's  and i'm an undergraduate student at duke university. i'm part of a research team for the data analysis and statistical inference course.i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience. in the next 20 minutes or so, i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course and some questions about how you feel about coursera courses in general.you can tell me as much or as little as you like. if you prefer not to answer some of the questions, then that's perfectly fine as well.your privacy is very important to me. after the interview is over, i'll remove your name and the email address from my notes. this way, nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity.your email address will be stored separately, so that we can use it to send you the $20 amazon gift certificate as a token of our gratitude for your participation.to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i'd like to audio record our conversation, if that's ok with you.  yes. it's ok.  after my notes and the audio recording from our conversation are transcribed, i'll delete the recording.your participation is completely voluntary, at any point, you may choose to stop. your interview will not affect your class performance, nor does the professor know whether or not you participated in the research. i want to confirm that you're 18 years or older?  yes.  if you could tell me a little bit about yourself, what kind of work you like to do, what you like to do in your spare time, that'd be great.  i'm an it professional with 20   plus years of experience in the it, doing computer programming, doing project management, also some other tasks like implementation, talking to customers, customer support.the demands of the it business are such that you need to learn all the time, so in the spare time, i try to do some hobbies. i try to get out of life something. i also need to learn. coursera and other books are another way to improve yourself and unfortunately you need to sacrifice your leisure also to be able to participate in those courses.  what kind of academic background do you have?  i have the equivalent of master of science in electronics and telecommunication. i also have an mba degree done as the postgraduate study. basically master of science.  do you have any background in statistics, specifically?  not really, other than the general business training typical for mba. no background in statistics.  what made you decide to enroll on the course?  i'm trying to ride on the wave of big data analytics and basic statistics course fits very well in that. it is the foundations of the analysis being done and the rest is just algorithms, so it fits into the bigger picture of the big data analytics, which is kind of trending in the recent years. i hope to benefit from that.  if this course wasn't available, was there another way you could learn the material?  ask again, or maybe use a different wording?  sorry. if this course wasn't online, would there be another way you could learn it?  not really, because it would mean enrolling onto some university and i wouldn't have time to do that. if i wanted to enroll on duke, it would be completely unreachable, because i'm six time   zones away from you.  how many hours would you estimate that you spent per week on the course?  very good question, because many students were complaining or noticing on the forums that it takes much longer than two or three hours which were promised.unfortunately i was not doing that kind of statistics, so i'm not sure. maybe it could have been five hours or even more per week, very approximately. unfortunately i was not keeping track of my time. could have, but i didn't need it.  what components of the course do you participate in?  each and every component. i watched all the video lectures, and also i read through the slides, through the presentations afterwards. preparing for quizzes, preparing for exams. also, went through all the quizzes, all the programming.it was called labs. i participated in everything possible, with the exception of forum, which i read only occasional. i didn't participate on the forums. didn't have time for that. but otherwise, i took advantage of each and every piece of that course. i enjoyed every minute of that.  if you could tell me about how you felt about the lectures, and the quizzes, and the labs?  they were excellent, because they were prepared in the very good way. they were conceptually very mature, very well   prepared, meaning that the requirements were described precisely. the hints were given clearly. you knew, what you are expected to do.also, what was beneficial, the quizzes were very difficult. there was no simplification points were quite typical. you need to prepare very well to take the quizzes. if you failed once, the next quiz would be slightly different. a significant part of [indecipherable 7:15] of the quiz was contained different questions.it cost a lot of work on the part of the organizers of this. very well   prepared. very difficult. very challenging.i could have taken a much more complicated program called lab assignments, because i have programming background, and i also have r programming background [indecipherable 7:43] different, other coursera courses, so the labs could have been more challenging for me, but they were still very enjoyable.i was very glad to take them. the programming was trivial. it could have been more ambitious for me, personally.  did you use r studio, as opposed to data camp?  kind of. i went through that track, but i used r command line. it's even a [indecipherable 8:16] .  the command line.  [indecipherable 8:20] r commands. for me, it doesn't matter, because i simply enjoy command line more.  you said didn't participate in the forums, but if you had more time, would you be interested in forming the community with your peers?  not necessarily. at the moment, i'm not building any online communities. i don't even have a profile on linkedin. i need to mature to set it up.i don't interest in that kind of, let's say, networking. i could have participated. i did it in the past on different coursera courses.in some, let's call it professional discussions; explaining some things, sending fixes, watching on some other explanations given by other participants. not to do the networking. not to find some [indecipherable 9:26] some colleagues. not really. i don't need it.  did you know anyone taking the course?  no.  can you tell me how the coursera learning experience compares to past educational experiences?  i think i should compare it to coursera, because comparing to a traditional education is...it's maybe not representative to the sample. this course was very well   prepared and was very difficult, which was good. very, very positive experience.compared to other courses, there are some courses on coursera which are very badly prepared. that bad preparation is compensated by significant ease of taking exams, taking tests, but in fact you don't learn that much. you earn the certificate.this statistic wasn't like those courses, you needed to work very hard to earn your degree. so, this is very positive, i can even compare it to the classics, to machine learning by andrew ng from stanford university, that machine learning was kind of more programming. i think that statistical inference is comparable to the best courses on coursera, like machine learning.  we're glad you enjoyed it.when you say the course is important to you, is it more important to get the certificate or just to learn material?  i have some significant doubts about the value of those online certificates. i have little experience, because i am not very pro   actively looking for another job. i don't think how these certificates are accepted by prospective employees, particularly if you are not on the paid track, but rather on the anonymous free track, which i am.so mostly some [indecipherable 11:54] knowledge gaining experience competences, but not the certificate, although it is also very motivating to be above 80 percent and get the certificate with distinction. i'm not sure i would be able to use it.maybe now you would be, because many prospective employees most likely are unaware of what books are and what they mean and what those certificates are worth of. maybe now, for some months or years these certificates are important, but ultimately i am not sure if they will be really very valuable, but we will see, huh?  yes, probably in the next few years they might gain more importance, but right now, who knows? how has this course affected how you feel about statistics?[]  hello?  yes, i'm online. i get some very important gut feeling about statistics.i knew and was capable of using some statistical methods, mostly computational methods, like linear regression, logistical regression. i knew what was standard deviation, mean, but i didn't have that gut feeling, what they are. i didn't have the gut feeling of what statistics is all about, knew nothing about those hypothesis testing or about denying hypothesis.now, i have a very good gut feeling of what statistics is all about and it's a very good foundation for all the other competences i already gained on other courses, which are more advanced statistical methods in the direction of machine learning.now my knowledge, which i already collected, gained foundations. previously it was hanging in the air, now i've got the foundation.  good. would you recommend this as a good course to anyone that you know?  yes, absolutely. it's terrific, it's worth every minute you spend on it. it costs you some time and effort, but it's worth it, every minute was enjoyable.  great. are you likely to take more statistics classes now? or more machine learning?  sorry, have...[]  sorry, i think you got out.  if the question is if i'm likely to take more courses of statistics and machine learning, then i heard it.so, i think i need a break now. i have taken like a total of eight moocs...  wow, that's a lot.  ... so far, within the last year and i need a break now. it's summer and i have less time in general, but anyway i reached a point that i was maybe a little exhausted, because i'm working full time.also have some challenging job, which requires quite often more than eight hours a day. if you spend the weekend doing some mooc courses, you end up working 24 7 and it's very, very challenging.i need some rest, i need to probably leverage now that knowledge i gained, see if it makes sense and if it helps me, but not jump into more and more courses, because it's simply too exhausting for me.  ok. how has this course affected how you feel about coursera or online moocs?  it moved my opinion in the positive direction, because as i've told already it's a very, very good course, unlike many others on coursera and other platforms. it increased my opinion on the technology.what will come out of that and how will it affect education is the big mystery for me. i don't know, but i definitely can say for sure that, if you pick carefully, you are able to find very ambitious and high   profile courses on the coursera.which are the equivalent of, let's call, traditional education and can be equally good. also, on coursera there is some crap, so you need to pick up carefully to find the good courses.  definitely. after you are done with taking a break or whatever, how likely are you to take a coursera course for fun, rather than just for work?  i'm unlikely to do that, because, frankly speaking, nowadays i don't have much time to do anything for fun, so i'm very unlikely to do that. maybe when i'm retired, in 20 years.  [laughs] ok. have you heard of any criticisms of coursera courses, or do you have any criticisms?  not about this particular one, but in general yes, some people on the forums confirm my opinion that some courses are not so demanding and you're able to gain the certificate even with distinction without devoting that much effort.the useful content is limited and the requirements we should meet are limited. regarding that course statistical interference, i had only heard one complain which was that it demanded more time than to off two, three hours a week. this is the only complaint, i think. otherwise it's absolutely perfect course. i really enjoy it.  those were all the questions that i had for you but is there anything else you'd like for me to know about the course, where you're experienced or do you have any questions for me?  well i was wondering, what's the purpose of scientist investing their time and effort in preparing those courses?i understand that dr. [indecipherable 19:09] didn't have to prepare all the materials from the beginning because she already had some. unlike online courses distributed by more traditional means, not mooc.she leverages the existing material but it's still a lot of time to compile it, to put it online. what motivates you to do that?  i think we want to learn the different experience that students online have, because our courses are paired up with the introduction to chemistry course. we're doing a research team for both.we're just trying to see how we can measure success for these students because both of these classes also are taught at duke in the same exact manner. we want to see the difference in learning and success. we did get a very large grant last year to put this course online.part of the motivation. mainly the professors enjoy teaching and wants to put it online and reach as many students as possible.  oh i see. [indecipherable 20:23] both courses but you mean that one course is mooc and the other is on duke. but both are statistically inference, or is there another course at duke...[crosstalk]  we have the statistical inference course at duke as well, as an introduction to statistics course. we are also paired up with introduction to chemistry course that's online right now, because the professors wanted to do this mooc project together. that course is also at duke as well.we're doing similar surveys and experiments for both of them, just to compare in class versus online experiences.  ok, i understand, thank you. i have one more question because i took part in a kind of not so very good course. it was on soft skills, developing innovative ideas for new companies. the first step in entrepreneurship.still, from my course in management. it wasn't very difficult to pass. also, because i have managerial background, so i took it and then it was free. it was on coursera.then i received the offer to study the complete course of study, not a single subject but the equivalent of the degree, which you however could earn completely online. you needed to pay the typical amount of money for education. i believe it might have been $20,000.you can earn that degree from the university of maryland, college park. you could earn it completely online.are you thinking about such an offering that some of the complete courses of study can be transferred online beyond coursera? is it the trend?  at the moment i don't think that's where we're headed, because it takes a lot of time to put these courses online. it wouldn't be able to happen for a while if they did that. our statistic department is very baysian. not many people might take that trend as well.  ok. i think this is it.  ok great. so we'll send you the $20 amazon gift certificate within the next week or so. this is a token of our gratitude for your participation. thank you so much for volunteering to participate.  thank you.  if you have any questions at a later time, please feel free to contact me at the duke moocs gmail. i hope you have a great day and thank you so much for your time.  ok, [indecipherable 23:35] thank you.  no problem. all right, see you.  bye bye.  bye.      transcription by castingwords\tS8\tMale\tGraduate\t<20000\t35-44\tPoland\tEurope\tStat\n",
      "35\ti just have a little quick spiel to go through before we start.my name's , and i'm an undergraduate at duke university in the united states. i'm part of the research team for the data analysis and statistical inference course. i'm interested in learning more about the coursera student experience, so in the next 20 to 30 minutes i'll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and some questions about how you feel about coursera in general.you can tell me as much or as little as you'd like. if you prefer not to answer some questions, that's perfectly fine as well.your privacy is very important to me, so after this interview i will remove your name and email address from my notes. this way nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity.your email address will be stored separately from my notes, so that we can send you the $20 amazon gift certificate as a token of our gratitude. to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i'd like to audio record our conversation, if that's ok with you?  it's fine.  afterwards, we are going to transcribe them and then i'll delete the recording.your participation is completely voluntary, so at any point you may choose to stop, and your interview won't affect your class performance in any way. the instructor has no idea whether or not you've participated in this research.finally, i just want to confirm that you are 18 years old or older.  yes.  if you could just tell me a little about yourself, where you're from, what kind of things you like to do in your spare time, what kind of work you do, that'd be great.  i have been working for three years for a german company and now i'm living in shanghai, china. the reason i take the coursera courses is because i have applied in graduate programs in the us. it's important for me to get used to the english lessons first. this data analysis is important to my future study, so that's why i chose this class. anything else?  i'm sorry i didn't hear when you said what work you do.  a german company. it's a chemical company, but i am in the marketing department.  what kind of educational background do you have?  bachelor degree.  in marketing?  math science [inaudible 03:04] .  have you had any statistics courses in the past?  yes, in chinese.  so you have some knowledge about it?  yes, i have.  how do you plan to use the material you learned in the course?  the most important way is i need to learn the terms in english.  if this course wasn't available, is there another way you'd be able to find it? or find the material in english.  excuse me?  if the course wasn't available, is there another way you could learn this material in english?  it's quite valuable, the course. i can study week by week and it's very carefully arranged so i can learn it. i do not need to spend much time to finding the materials but just follow the videos.  so far, how many hours do you think you've spent per week on the course?  about five to eight hours per week.  what components of the course do you participate in? like the lectures, the quizzes, the labs, do you do all of it? or are there some specifically?  all of it. all of the parts.  how do you feel about the lectures and the quizzes?  they're not very difficult, but you need to think.  has the english been easy for you to pick up on or follow? is the pace ok?  yes. at first i needed to see the transcript, but now i don't need that.  that's good. how important would you say this course is to you? do you plan to get the certificate? or are you just doing it to practice?  it's for practice.  have you had any interactions with other students in the class?  we have a study group in china. most of us talk about the class in chinese. sometimes i look at the forum but i do not send messages frequently.  are you taking the course with anyone you know personally?  no.  so you just met people from the course?  no.  how does this coursera learning experience compare to your past educational experiences?  it's quite different because we have more interactions. we can talk about the class in forums, although i do not send messages frequently, but you can see all the opinions from the other students, and about projects, you can see the feedback from your peer classmates. it's because in my college study, [inaudible 06:46] electronics was very professional, and it was very difficult.i learned it with great effort, but this one, it's much easier. i spend less time. sometimes it's just for fun. lessons to sound english, lessons to learn the terms, and even in our chinese study groups we talk about the lesson, the teacher, and some about our own work, our own life.  how has this course affected how you feel about statistics?  i have learned that in my college, but it's a little different from this course. i'm not sure how to say that in english, but it feels more professional, and some of the most important part is the r language. i have never learned it before, not that it's very difficult to learn, and it's quite useful. i can even use it to solve simple questions in my everyday life.  did you use the r platform or do you use datacamp?  both. i used datacamp to finish the lab every week, and i used...what is the other?  just rstudio.  yeah, rstudio. i used that to practice and to find something i am interested in.  how did you like datacamp?  i think it's too...because you can find the solution for each question, sometimes if i am in a hurry, i would skip thinking and just find the solution. it's not very good.  yeah, it's hard to avoid them. how likely are you to take more statistics courses?  maybe when i am in the us, but not from the internet.  would you recommend this specific course to anyone that you know?  yeah, it's very interesting and practical.  how has this course affected how you feel about coursera or other coursera   style courses?  i have taken another course on this platform. it's competitive strategy. both of them are not very difficult, but this one has more ways for us to learn, such as the lab, the projects, and there are more possibilities coursera can offer to us.  how likely are you to take another coursera course?  i am planning to take some art courses, just for fun.  just for fun. that was my next question. would you be likely to take courses for fun other than art? are there other things that interest you?  not very.  what kind of art classes are there?  maybe music or art history.  what about other courses for school or work? would you take more courses for that?  pardon?  what about other courses for school or work? would you take more courses for that?  maybe not for now.  have you heard of any criticisms of coursera courses, or do you have any criticisms of the online platform?  it's very slow to fill it in china, and some of the data we cannot [inaudible 11:39] when we do the projects, we count about it always being bigger. the professor has provided another way for the chinese students but sometimes we can't, we just can't. the video i usually download it because it is very slow to watch it online, but if you download it you cannot see the quizzes in the video. i think that is not your problem, though.  would it be useful to have the video with the downloads, the questions on the side?  yeah, that would be great.  those are all the questions that i have. do you have anything you'd like for me to know about your experience with the course? do you have any questions for me?  i have one question. how do you set the deadlines? it's on monday, right? why is it on monday?  for the final?  all the coursework. every day, the lab, the quizzes, all on monday. all the deadlines.  i'm not really sure, but it's probably because that way people have the weekend to do it.  it's bad. it would be better if you set it during the week. usually i spend my weekends learning the whole week. i practice. if it's the middle of the week you can learn the courses and spend the first one or two days to do the test, that would be much easier for me. i would not be that busy during weekends.  that's something we can look into. i think most courses have it monday   to   monday, but i'm not sure. we can definitely look into that for the future. do you have any suggestions on anything else, or feedback on different aspects of the course?  no.  do you have any other questions?  no, that's all.  in the next week or so we'll email you the $20 amazon gift certificate, and if you have any questions please feel free to contact me at the duke moocs gmail email. if you have any questions, please email me, and we're really grateful that you're participating in our study. hopefully, we can improve the course for the students in the future.  thank you. thank you for your time.  no problem. have a good night.  good night.  see you.  bye.      transcription by castingwords\tS9\tFemale\tBachelor\t50000-74999\t25-34\tChina\tAsia\tStat\n"

       "'so the first thing that we\\'re going to do is i\\'m going to tell you a little bit about myself and the research that i\\'m working on, and then i\\'ll give you a chance to ask any questions that you may have, and then we can get started with our interview. does that sound good with you? yeah, that is fine with me. ok, great. so my name is , and i\\'m an undergraduate student at duke university. i\\'m part of the research team... wait, i didn\\'t... i\\'m sorry? i didn\\'t quite get your...you said your name is? . . c-l... a-r-a. ok, that is fine. yes. and i\\'m interested in learning more about the coursera student experience. in the next 30 minutes, i will ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and how you feel about coursera in general. you can tell me as much or as little as you would like. if you prefer not to answer some of the questions, then that is perfectly fine. your privacy is important to me, so after this interview is over, your name and email address will be removed from my notes. that way, nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity. your email address will be stored separately. that is fine. your email address will be stored separately and be used to email you your amazon gift card. after all the data has been collected and all the interview participants have been paid, all of the identifying information will be destroyed. to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i would like to audio record our conversation. after my notes and the audio recording are transcribed, i will delete the recording.your participation is completely voluntary, and at any point, you may choose to stop the interview. your interview will not affect your class performance in any way, and the instructor, dr. canelas, will not know whether or not you participated in this research. if you have questions about this research, please ask me at any point, and if you have questions at a later time, please contact dukecoursera gmail.com. finally, i would just like to confirm that you are 18 years or older. is that true? yes, definitely. yeah. ok, good. do you have any questions for me at this point? no. so far, i\\'m fine. please can you just hold on? there is a call coming in for me. just one minute. yeah.[background conversation] all right, , you can continue. the first question i have for you is just for you to tell me about yourself, if you are working, what kind of work you do, your academic background, anything that you find is important? i\\'m a lecturer at a university. i have qualifications in chemistry at masters\\' level. i\\'m teaching undergraduate pharmacy and medical student\\'s chemistry that\\'s relevant for their courses. before joining the university, i spent about 18 years teaching science at high school. i have extensive knowledge of chemistry and teaching of the subject. i think that is basic information about me. what made you decide to take this course? like i said, teaching undergraduate students chemistry, some of them are coming from very poor background, very weak knowledge of chemistry. learning this, putting myself in the position of a student and learning these through coursera also improves the way i interact with my student, especially those that are coming from very poor background. have you taken coursera courses before this course? yes, i did one on the use of chromatography, which i found quite useful. in fact, that was why i felt encouraged to take this one that i\\'m currently running. how did you hear about coursera? i got information from my dean, who is actually a british citizen. he found it useful because it gives him the opportunity to revise his chemistry. that was when he referred us to that site. when i looked it up, i found it quite useful as well. do you think that if this material was not available on coursera, would you look for a different way to learn this material? of course. to me, it\\'s not really learning anything new as such, but to see how the materials are organized, to make a more powerful impact on the student. like i said, me especially, most of the information is not new to me. but the way they organize the material makes them, probably we\\'re not there. i would again like to see how this material could be organized [inaudible 06:36] on the students. how many hours do you think that you, per week, spend on this course? like i said, i\\'m not really new to it. even if i spend about two hours as such, it refreshes my mind very well that it makes me deliver my lectures better, to interact with the student at a better rate, roughly about two hours a week, mostly weekends. what part of the course do you participate in? there is lot of parts to it. there is the video lectures, the quizzes, the problem sets, the discussion forums, what parts do you take part in? just hold on a little bit, .[background conversation] yeah, we can continue. the next question i had for you is \"what parts of the course do you participate in?\" i watch the videos, the materials, the quizzes. i have not been able to start with the quiz, but i intend to at least participate in some of the quizzes before the end of the course. the videos and the presentations are quite important, i watch those ones regularly. are you interested in getting the certificate at the end, the statement of accomplishment? definitely, yes. like the one i did on chromatography, i didn\\'t finish, so i didn\\'t get that certificate, but this one, i hope to complete it to at least have some recognition for my effort. have you interacted with any of the other students in the class? no, not yet. have you been on the discussion forums before? no. it\\'s actually the first time i\\'m there. like i said, i\\'m learning it to improve the deliverance of the topic so i\\'ve not been very active with other students. how is chemistry taught differently in the united states at duke university versus how it\\'s taught where you? where i am, like i said, because of the different background of students coming from diverse cultural groups, diverse levels of knowledge, so most of it is time. we have to go into didactic teaching really to explain concepts from scratch. because of lack of resources, we don\\'t really go into investigative method of teaching because of cost and time constraint.most of the time it\\'s didactic teaching, explaining everything concept every day and expect them to read the few materials that are available to them to have a good understanding of the subject matter. do you think that\\'s different from how chemistry is taught through the coursera course? yeah, because i see there that there are some aspects of investigation that students are encouraged to do. for instance, to do a little bit of investigation and see how things work. for instance, the one that i participated in was using simple chocolate to find out how we can use [inaudible 12:33] to separate it. this also makes it possible for my, what i teach, to refer to this simple investigation that a student can participate in without necessarily going to the lab.i see that component, quite interesting, and a powerful way to get information through to the students. let\\'s see. how do you think that this course, learning chemistry through this, compares to how you learned chemistry when you first learned it? like i said, it\\'s quite different coming from a poor resources setting. we only have access to laboratories that are probably not well-equipped and we\\'re not that fortunate to be aware that one can actually do some of these things outside the laboratory. the way coursera is presenting the lectures and giving relevant information of things that can be done outside the lab really makes it very different from the way we were taught.we thought those days that you could only do chemistry having a well-equipped laboratory outside the environment. from the coursera perspective, we see that some of the investigation we need to do can be done outside a lab. that aspect really makes it quite impressive and makes chemistry quite relevant in everyday life. with that, it\\'s quite powerful to mention it to understand that what they are being taught is not something that is so abstract.rather, it\\'s something that has impact in their day-to-day life, something that\\'s relevant in their everyday life. that makes it quite interesting and very different from the way we were taught. do you any of your students take coursera courses? not yet. what we just decided this academic year, by next semester what i intend to do, because i downloaded some of the courses i took on chromatography, that is when i will be teaching that topic. my intention is to let them have access to those materials and, naturally, encourage them to take some other courses because it makes it a lot easier for us to understand ourselves in the class if they have exposure.by the second semester, hopefully right about june, i\\'m going to really encourage them to get ready for these courses that we\\'re at that time. do you think that where you are is online learning a common thing or is it not very common? it is coming a bit commonplace. with the availability to internet access, the internet, and skype, lots of students are becoming interested. for instance, sometimes i would teach a subject and refer them to youtube, to google to get more information, more than what the lecture would give. it\\'s gradually picking up, yeah.one of my colleagues did his diploma in management and his course was 100 percent online. that has encouraged some of us to step in that direction to improve our standing. how do you think the quality of online courses compares to the quality of in-classroom courses? i think the quality is quite high because, looking at the chemistry course i\\'m currently doing, it has all the components that we have in our school. there was even a time when i was teaching [inaudible 16:54] i looked up some materials of old lecture that were presented. that\\'s actually helped me to compile my own study guide for my students. i think the quality is quite high. it\\'s quite high comparable to what you have in former schools. how do you feel about courses that are styled like coursera courses, courses with thousands of students that learn together online? how do you feel about those? sorry, i didn\\'t get your question. how do you feel about online courses that are taught in this style of coursera? to me, i think it\\'s a privilege to have access to such courses because if you look at some of the people that are full employment maybe not being able to get sponsorship to go for four time studies. the few hours we have at our disposal, we can put them to use productively through this kind of online studies.especially, the work we\\'re now trying to do is to see if the government can recognize such online course because, like i said, this is just picking up. with time we hope the government will give recognition to such knowledge acquired online.once we\\'re at that stage i think it becomes quite indispensable, especially for people that are doing full-time work. they will be able to contribute to, and build themselves a lifelong learning, to continually improve themselves in what they do. i think it\\'s quite important. what do you think are some difficulties to online learning? one of the major challenges we have is in some of these [inaudible 19:06] , sometimes internet is a problem. sometimes we don\\'t have connectivity. sometimes you try to log-on to websites, the library, you have to pay some fees. if you don\\'t pay that you don\\'t have access to this library.i think a major problem is the unstable network availability. sometimes you don\\'t have network. in fact, i could have taken this call at my place but the service there is quite weak. we might not be able to communicate, that\\'s why i\\'m still in my office now, at the university, where the internet is bit stronger. this is why we are able to discuss now.in some settings, in some locations in the city where i\\'m staying the internet provision is quite weak, which makes it quite difficult to connect with an online study. yeah, i think, for now, that is a major problem and access to resources online. for which people have to register with a credit card. those are not very popular here at the moment. how likely do you think you are to continue taking coursera courses? like i said, at the university we have a steady and strong internet provision. if there is a breakdown we have a team of it technicians that quickly come to our rescue to fix this thing. in my current situation i think i\\'m well placed to undertake any course online.i have an office computer. i have my private laptop, which makes it quite easy for me, too.as we are talking now, my office computer doesn\\'t have a webcam, so i\\'m using my private laptop to communicate with you now. normally we can get some of this from the university, so in my present situation i think i\\'m well placed to do courses online. what kind of course do you think you will take? are you more likely to take courses in your area of study, in chemistry, or are you also interested in taking courses that are completely out of your area of study? i am actually at the moment searching for online courses that i can do in my area of specialization, for research. i\\'m a chemist. i\\'m trying to register online to do a phd. if i see a reputable online....[] hello? hello.. ok, yeah. can you pick up where you left off, about you trying to get a phd online? yes, i was saying that. you asked a question about if i\\'m prepared to take further online courses in my area of specialization or general areas. i said, \"yes.\" i am currently searching for a reputable online institution where i can enroll to study a phd program in chemistry.of course, i will also be interested to do courses in other areas, especially management, curriculum development, and how to maybe organize yourself properly. those are the minor courses online.yes, i\\'m willing to take such courses. but the primary one i want to pursue at the moment is to register for a full phd program online because, as a family person, i really don\\'t want to travel out of the country to go and do three years of study again. if i have an opportunity to do it online i will gladly take that opportunity. those are all the questions that i had specifically for you. do you have anything else that you would like to add to our conversation? yes, i want to find out...many times i scroll through courses offered by coursera. i\\'m just wondering if they are looking at the possibility of improving or including in their courses things like if one can upgrade.like if one does chemistry, if they can do advanced chemistry studies with coursera. i just want to find out if they have plans in the near future to include such things in the program. i work more with duke university than i work with coursera. i\\'m not quite sure about the upcoming courses on coursera. i know that, just in my conversations that i\\'ve had with other coursera students, there is an advanced chemistry course that is currently being offered. i\\'m not sure what university it\\'s offered by, but you could search for that and see if that\\'s available to you? let\\'s talk about duke university. do they have a phd program in medicinal chemistry? will you know? yeah, there is a phd program but it is not available online. it would only be at the school. at the school, residential. ok, all right. if you do come up with any other questions or comments at a later point in time you can always email me at dukecoursera gmail.com and i will get back to you. your amazon gift card should be in your email later today, in a few hours. but if for whatever reason it\\'s not, again, please feel free to send me an email and i will get that figured out for you. ok, thank you very much. thank you for your time. my pleasure. bye. have a good rest of the day. ok, thank you very much. goodbye, have a nice evening. bye...'"
