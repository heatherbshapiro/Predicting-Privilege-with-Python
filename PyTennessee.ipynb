       "'can you hear me all right now? oh, yeah. you\\'ve always sounded fine, and the problem is getting it to pick up on me talking. oh, ok. yeah, i can hear you as well, so that\\'s great. so i guess the first thing we\\'re going to do in our interview is i\\'m just going to tell you a little bit about myself and the research that i\\'m working on, and then i\\'ll give you a chance to ask any questions that you might have, and then we can get started. does that sound good with you? yeah, great. great. so my name is , and i\\'m an undergraduate student at duke university. i\\'m part of the research team for the introduction to chemistry course, and i\\'m interested in learning more about the coursera student experience. in the next 30 minutes or so, i\\'ll ask you some questions about yourself, your participation in the course, and how you feel about coursera in general.you can tell me as much or as little as you\\'d like, and if you don\\'t want to answer any of the questions, then that\\'s totally fine. your privacy of course is important to me, so after this interview is over, i will remove your name and email address from my notes. that way, nobody who reads my research will have access to information on your identity.your email address will be stored separate from my notes and be used to email you your amazon gift card. as soon as all the data has been collected and all the interview participants have been paid, all of the information will also be destroyed.to make sure that i understand and accurately write what you tell me, i would like to audio record our conversation. after my notes and audio recording from our conversation are transcribed, i will delete that recording as well.you participation, of course, is completely voluntary. and at any point, you may choose to stop the interview. your interview will not affect your class performance in any way and the instructor dr. darrien conolos will not know whether or not you participated in this research.if you have questions about this research, please ask me at any point. and if you have questions at a later time, feel free to email dukecoursera gmail.com. finally, i would just like to confirm that you are 18 years or older. is that correct? oh, yeah. i\\'m 22 actually. ok. perfect. then we can get started. let\\'s see. the first question i have for you is pretty general. if you could you just tell me about yourself - if you\\'re still in school, if you\\'re working a job, what kind of work you do, just anything you find relevant to this interview. ok. i was in school. two years ago was the last semester i was in. i did not graduate. i actually had to leave because i lost a decent part of my financial aid. i did a lot of social stuff. i let that get in the way a whole lot. i knew it even then that that was exactly was wrong.i don\\'t think i\\'m going back to that particular school. i was studying at nku. i almost went to university of louisville instead. and i want to move to louisville eventually. so if i go back to a four-year school, that\\'s most likely where i\\'ll be.i changed my major a lot when i was in school. i started off undeclared. i thought i would go into pharmacy. and i\\'m still interested in science. but i don\\'t think i\\'m really going to do pharmacy. i\\'m actually in the intro to pharmacy class on coursera. and i like it, but it\\'s not really what i thought it was going to be.the last majors had declared when i left were biology and spanish. and i think i\\'m still going to stick with those two. and i don\\'t know what i\\'m actually going to do with them. but i know i want to study them. [audio breaks] two jobs in the meantime - none of them really have anything to do with biology or spanish, though i speak some spanish at them.that\\'s why my availability was so weird actually - the schedules for both of them changes on a weekly basis. ok. what are the two jobs that you are working at currently, if you don\\'t mind my asking? oh, i don\\'t mind. i work in a restaurant for one of them. i\\'m a hostess. i do all the takeout orders. eventually, i\\'m going to be cross-trained to serving and doing expo in the kitchen too. eventually, i\\'m kind of going to know how to do everything. and are you familiar with newport aquarium by chance? i am not. all right. well i live in newport, kentucky. and we have an aquarium here. for people that are into marine science, it\\'s pretty well-known because we have as shark ray that recently had pups. it\\'s actually the first time a shark ray in captivity has successfully been bred.and i don\\'t work with the animals there. i do photography there. one of the things i\\'m looking into is possibly working there after i\\'m done with school - if i don\\'t move to louisville - because they do have biologist all the time that do all the animal care. they do lab work. right. for now though, it\\'s just pictures. ok. cool. so, let\\'s see. what would say that your background is in science and math? would you say that you have a strong background in science and math, or a weak background in science and math? for math, i would say it\\'s moderate. and i might be underestimating myself there, to be honest, because i seem to get better test scores and everything in it than i usually expect. i actually started off with an extremely weak background in science. i had that one high school teacher that changed my entire opinion on it and everything. and since then, i think i\\'ve been doing pretty well. how many chemistry courses have you taken before this course? if any. just the one in high school that was required and into to chemistry for college, which didn\\'t actually go very well - very, very fast-paced professor. i needed someone who was a little slower.this class seems to be going better for me. the professor is very good about going at a good pace in the lecture videos. and i really do appreciate that. right. so what made you decide to enroll in this course? actually, the fact that i didn\\'t do very well in my university into to chemistry. after i had to leave school, i ended up buying a couple books to self-teach myself. and one of them is for introduction to chemistry, because a lot of the math concepts in there are where i started to get lost. and eventually i would get them, but by then, they\\'d move on to something else... right. ...so i kept falling behind. and i found out about coursera through someone i know who\\'s about to graduate, because she wanted to take classes on there. and i saw that introduction to chemistry was on there. and i thought, \"hey, why not?\" right. just reinforce what my own book is teaching me. so what is the motivation for learning chemistry period, i guess, even apart from this course? my motivation for learning chemistry originally was that i thought i was going to go into pharmacy. medical science was always something i was especially interested in. but i know that i might not do as well handling patients directly as i would doing other things for them, such as working with the medicine. ok. and i know that is a very chemistry heavy career. and even if i don\\'t do pharmacy after all, i know that i need a good chemistry background for the biology degree. so, i guess, ultimately you\\'re hoping that it will apply to you in your work setting in some way. is that correct? that\\'s absolutely correct. yes. ok. sorry, i\\'m typing and talking. let\\'s see. if this course was not available to you through coursera, would you seek out another way to learn this material? if it was at another learning website, yeah. coursera is the only one i use. but i know that there are other ones out there. and i don\\'t know why their names are escaping me right now. do you think that you would ever pay for this course or a similar kind of online courses? i actually thought about doing signature track and the ace got recommendations for a lot of the classes i\\'m in. right now, the main thing that\\'s stop me is - other than university of louisville, none of the schools i may be returning to later this year would take ace credit. ok - would take the credit. let\\'s see. how many hours would you say per week that you spend on this course? at least three. it\\'s kind of all over the place. i watch the lectures when i can between work. and it\\'s often at night - pretty late at night. i know i put in two hours straight in one of the classes before. three to six maybe. three to six, ok. are you currently on track with the course? are you on week four or are you on a later week? i\\'m a little bit behind actually. there was a lot of personal stuff that came up in the past couple weeks that put me behind in several of my classes. i think i\\'m in five or six coursera classes right now. it\\'s six. one of them just started. i haven\\'t looked at that one yet.but besides the chemistry, i\\'m also in the intro to genetics, and the astro biology, the intro to pharmacy, intro to human physiology. and the epidemiology one just started. ok. are you on track with all of the courses? do you find it difficult to manage all of them at the same time? it\\'s kind of difficult. yes. i am trying. my idea when i enrolled in all of them was, \"let me see if i can handle two jobs and roughly the equivalent of a full-time college course load at the same time.\" and i\\'m in a different place in all of the classes, i guess. i\\'m fine in astro biology. i\\'m actually in my final week of that one. i\\'m expecting to get a statement of accomplishment for that one.i\\'m hanging in there in genetics. that\\'s the most interesting one to me. it\\'s kind of fast-paced. but, i\\'m trying. physiology, i\\'m not as interested in as i thought i would be, so it\\'s just hard to get me to focus on that one having the same issue with pharmacy. but i\\'m doing ok in those. and then, chemistry, i\\'m kind of behind in. but i\\'m not sure if it\\'s that i\\'m still having trouble with the math or if i\\'m worried i\\'m going to do well in it, because i know at one point, i almost gave up on the book i had, because i got to about the thermodynamics point in it. i just thought, \"i don\\'t want to do this anymore. this is where i started messing up in school.\" what week would you say that you\\'re approximately at in the chemistry course? i know i\\'m in week three material. sorry, go ahead. it\\'s ok. it has been a couple of days since i\\'ve looked at the lecture videos for chemistry. i would probably need to actually pull up where i\\'m at on there. yeah, no worries. what components of the course do you participate in? i know there are the video lectures, the quizzes, the discussion forums and all of that stuff. what parts are you active on? i watch the video lectures. i\\'m trying to make sure i watch all of them. i do the quizzes, because i do want to know how well i\\'m grasping the material. i don\\'t really take part in the discussion forums. i may have posted in there once or twice, but it\\'s not really something i look at. if it was required for the class, i think i would do it more, but...i don\\'t know.i have online classes that are in nku, and i was the same way for those unless it was required, i didn\\'t really do the discussion. when you watch the lecture videos, do you just watch them straight through or do you find yourself stopping and going back a lot? for chemistry, i usually can watch them straight through. she goes at a really good pace for me to just be able to take notes and keep looking up every once in a while. then some of my other classes, i have to pause them a lot, like for genetics, a 20-minute video might take me at least 30 minutes to get through, because i\\'ll keep pausing it. for chemistry, if it\\'s a 15-minute video, it usually takes you more or less 15 minutes to finish it? 15 to maybe 20 minutes. sometimes, i pause them but not much. have you interacted with any of the other students in the course? if i have, then i may have posted in the forums once when the class first started, but that would\\'ve been it. are you interested in forming that kind of a community with the other students in the course. is this more of a project for yourself? this is very largely a project for myself. i had a lot of confidence issues with having to leave school. i was really embarrassed that i had to leave. because it\\'s not that i felt that i have trouble with learning things on collegiate level. it\\'s not i can\\'t focus on them, i get distracted. me trying to take all these classes was less for meeting people for now and more for seeing that i can do it if i tried to.although, in my genetics, when i know i did have a conversation with a couple of people in early in the class. how would you say that, having recently been in a college setting, how does this coursera learning experience compare with the in-classroom learning experience? i really like it, and i\\'m really glad i stumbled upon it. it was actually someone i was telling about it who put it best. it\\'s a lot less about everything else that goes around you in college, such as, let\\'s see, i stutter a lot, i\\'m sorry.i lived in the dorms when i was going to northern too, and it wasn\\'t just about the classes and studying. there was always something else going on around me. i was in student organizations. i had to keep up with those. on coursera, it\\'s just about me and whatever i feel like learning and i can take all the time i want to on it. it\\'s online, i don\\'t have to travel 30 minutes out of my way. then having been on coursera, what do you think is the advantage of going to brick-and-mortar like an actual school? i do know that a lot of employers look at brick-and-mortar in a bit of better light than online ones. i was messing around with the idea of a third job not too long ago and i did try a couple of interviews. one person interviewing me didn\\'t really think much of the fact that i was taking online classes, i couldn\\'t get credit from an actual institution for.i\\'ve never seen a lot of people seem to think that way. they seem to think that because it\\'s online, because it\\'s free, it might carry less weight. i disagree with that myself, because i can tell you a lot of what i\\'m seeing in this chemistry class, i saw in a brick-and-mortar school and in a book i bought for $30. speaking of books, have you purchased the textbook that\\'s recommended with this class? i have not. i was just kind of hoping that for now, the one i have was enough to get me through it. which one do you have if i can ask that? i don\\'t have it on me. i can\\'t tell you what it\\'s called unless i see it, but it\\'s a book that i saw in a bookstore for self-teaching chemistry. it said on there that it\\'s not recommended solely for chemistry, but that would make a good supplemental text.my bookshelf is across the room, and i think it\\'s in there. no worries, you don\\'t have to get it, it\\'s ok. let\\'s see. how does this course affected how you feel about chemistry? i still kind of fear it. i don\\'t know. if i don\\'t immediately get a subject, i don\\'t like it. i guess i\\'m stubborn like that. then chemistry is extra frustrating me that i don\\'t always get it the first try, because i\\'m actually from a line of people in my family that go into chemistry-related careers. my father is a chemist, actually.i remember i would go visit him and talk to him about this intro course that i took when i was at school and everyone just kept asking me, \"how do you not get this? it\\'s not that hard.\" i\\'m not really sure why i wasn\\'t getting it right away, but i wasn\\'t. do you feel like that some of that fear is alleviated with this course? i think it\\'s helping that there\\'s not as too much pressure on me with this as there was at northern. obviously, at nku, i didn\\'t very well. that cost me scholarships. if i don\\'t do very well in the one on coursera, it\\'s disappointing, but there\\'s no actual harm done in the long run. are trying to get a certificate for this chemistry course, or you\\'re just picking out what you want to get out of it? i little bit of both. i would love if i could get a statement of accomplishment from it, but if i don\\'t, i\\'m not going to be extremely upset about it. ideally, i would get one from all of the classes i\\'m in. although, i\\'m not going to be surprised if that doesn\\'t happen. especially like i said, the past couple weeks, i haven\\'t been doing much with any of them. do you anticipate on being able to get a statement of accomplishment from this course? i\\'m honestly not sure. i did not do very well in some of the quizzes. there was one of them that i got about an equivalent of a 50 percent on and i\\'m not very happy about that. then there are others i got closer to 100 percent on.so let\\'s say my average is around a 70 to 75, i think that\\'s the bare minimum needed for a statement of accomplishment. if i keep doing good, then yeah. it\\'s an interesting subject, and i\\'m very afraid of it. how would you say you studied for this course? you watched the videos, what else do you do to prepare before the quizzes? do you take them right away? i take notes as i watch the videos. i do have a binder and it\\'s got all my classes separated in there. usually i\\'ll take the quiz right after i\\'m done with a set of videos, while it\\'s still fresh in my mind. if i can\\'t get to it right away or i don\\'t really feel like getting to it right away, then i just put the notes aside. i\\'ll go over them within an hour before i decide to try the quiz.when i was in high school i didn\\'t really study for anything. when i was in college, i probably should have, but i tried the same method. i very rarely actually studied. has this course changed how you feel about coursera in general? i don\\'t think it\\'s just the chemistry course, and i don\\'t think there was much of a change. i\\'ve always had a pretty positive opinion of coursera when i first got on there.i tried to jump right into classes i actually had no background for. i am glad they have introduction classes on there so i can eventually work up to those courses. you mentioned that you\\'re taking multiple classes at once. how many hours would you say per week, that you spend on them all together?[whistle] after biology, i know i\\'m spending about three or four a week on. the lectures are really quick and it\\'s the easiest one i have. genetics is a lot longer.the last week i had really good scores on the quizzes for that class, i spent around nine hours for the whole week. i was spending at least an hour a day.pharmacy, maybe three hours a week, like astro-biology. we\\'re at 15 hours for those three classes. then for physiology, about five or six hours. now we\\'re at 21.for chemistry, the first week, i think i put three or four into it. it was one of those times i stayed up late to try to do everything straight through.i haven\\'t started up in epidemiology yet. so i am looking at least 20 hours a week on everything. how would you say this compares? do you feel like you\\'re taking classes just in college, or does it feel different than being in college? it feels very different from being in college. i know there\\'s way more people in these classes for one thing. it\\'s the only class that i think is set up like the online class i had in nku as an intro-to-pharmacy one.i don\\'t mind the way the other ones are set up. but they feel less personal is the right phrase. it sounds negative and i don\\'t mean to sound negative about it. what are some things that you think are present in the classroom that coursera doesn\\'t offer? coursera for one thing, doesn\\'t say a whole lot about mid-terms and other grades. i know there are grades for the classes, but that\\'s not very emphasized.a lot of the [inaudible 22:25] i took at northern that was, obviously i\\'m not in person, and i only ever took two online classes at nku. i\\'m still not entirely used to the online class atmosphere, and when i do get on the forums, there\\'s way more activity there than on nku.but we\\'re also talking about a college with a few thousand versus there could be a 100 thousand people in this chemistry class by itself. do you like that coursera is less focused on grades? is that something that\\'s appealing to you? yes it is. i really need to work back up the confidence to get back into school. if everything goes well for me financially, i will be back in, in august. i really don\\'t want to be scared of it anymore.in coursera not being so focused on grades is helping. because if i was logging in everyday, and i just saw, worst case scenario, a bunch of f\\'s, which i\\'m pretty sure i don\\'t have in any of my classes. i wouldn\\'t really want to bother with them anymore. it would really be discouraging, that\\'s what i was trying to say. so coursera you would say, is something that is building up your confidence to go back to school? i think it is helping. how would you compare the difficulty of the courses? in comparison to your in class terms? i know the introduction in chemistry 1 in coursera, i\\'m seeing a lot of stuff on the same level as what i saw at nku. i just like the professor for the coursera class, goes in a pace that works a lot better for me.the material is about the same level of difficulty. the only class i have, that i feel like is extremely easy is, astro-biology because i feel like a lot of it is just astronomy and biology review.those were two of my best branches of science in high school and ever since. how would you compare how you\\'re evaluated, like, these quizzes versus the exams you would take in a college setting? the coursera quizzes are definitely easier. they don\\'t give you as many questions obviously. i don\\'t really get test anxiety. i\\'m actually really good with exams.exams already feel easy to me. sometimes the quizzes hardly feel like anything. do you think you\\'ve spent more time preparing for these quizzes, or more for your in class exams? definitely more for in class exams. there are no classes on coursera for which i would say that i get really worried about the quizzes or exams. it helps if they\\'re not in person i think.i don\\'t have to worry about being late to class. i don\\'t have to worry about do i have a pencil. i get very anxious and little things like that really aid at me when i was in school. you can probably tell i\\'m all over the place in this conversation. no not at all. what would you say are some things that you don\\'t like about the coursera course? i really wish they had a way to be more personal with everybody. i know that\\'s why they have teaching assistants for all the classes now, and i am glad they took that step.the first coursera class i ever tried was pretty advanced one in genetics, and i did not have the background for it at the time. there were no ta\\'s for that class.it was just the professor and one ta. the forums were all over the place. you didn\\'t really have many people moderating them. they still stayed on track for the discussion because everyone there had the background.when i had trouble with the class, i felt like there were more people that i could talk to. those are all the questions i have for you. do you have anything else that you would like to contribute to our conversation? i don\\'t really think i do. i do like that you guys are getting this information. i noticed that duke university does do several classes on the website. we do, yeah. actually the intro genetics i have is topped by mohamed noor over there. i know i keep going back to that one. that one is my favorite out of the one\\'s i\\'m taking right now. is it just the content of the material? or is there something about the organization? or is the teaching style? i really really like his teaching style. i like that he uses, well you guys do this for your class too, i like that there\\'s slides and there\\'s things i can write down in the notes.it\\'s not like astro-biology for example. where it\\'s just the professor talking in the video for the most part. he goes in a really slow pace which is really easy for me to get notes from that one.i\\'m a very visual learner. i like having things to look at that i can write down. i have to pause those videos a lot for notes, but it\\'s ok. he does a lot of information in each video.outside of just [inaudible 28:20] squares and high school biology, i didn\\'t really do much with genetics before. i get extremely interested.biology was always my strong point in science. actually, before i went for the biology major, i was all liberal arts stuff. which i\\'m still good at, i just don\\'t like it as much. with coursera, do you feel like it\\'s exposing you and new topics that you haven\\'t been able to explore before? absolutely. nku does not teach astro-biology, and i cannot get into genetics without taking at least two semesters or a piece of chemistry and biology first.i felt a little overwhelmed when i was in school because i don\\'t really have a career path in mind. i just know what i\\'m interested in studying.i\\'m just glad that i\\'m able to look into stuff on my own terms right now and see what i like, and don\\'t like. how do you motivate yourself when it comes to spending time on these courses? because you mentioned you\\'re working two jobs and you\\'re taking multiple classes at once.how do you motivate yourself to stay on track with all of them and keep up with them? i\\'m trying to be really relaxed about it. my anxiety does get in the way sometimes. there have been times i would watch videos and i either wouldn\\'t get the stuff the first time or i\\'d be pressed for time, or i was tired or wasn\\'t feeling well.when i was in school and that would happen, i would just get angry and i would either shut down and not even bother with it, or i would end up forgetting everything and not doing well on my test.for coursera, i just keep reminding myself, it\\'s ok, you can take a deep breath, get away from the computer for a little bit. come back later.i\\'ve been losing some sleep. i don\\'t always have enough hours in the day to do all this, but, i try to take at least one day out of the week, if i need to catch up on any sleep, i do. do you feel it\\'s rewarding for you to finish these courses? absolutely. even if there isn\\'t a direct grade involved or even if you don\\'t receive a certificate? so what is kind of like the reward that you feel? well, even if i don\\'t get statements for any of the classes, i can still say that i did it and i tried. and that\\'s a lot better than nothing.these classes all started in january for me. this past month was going to go by no matter what i was doing, but at least i can say i spent it trying to keep up with schoolwork in addition to work. and that\\'s a lot better than saying, \"oh, i just worked. no big deal.\" so, i guess one last question i have for you is how many hours would you say that you spent working per week? well, that\\'s all over the place. this week, i\\'m looking at between 30 and 40 between both jobs. and it\\'s usually a little over 40 a week. ok. my intention in getting a second job was to break 40 because the aquarium - that\\'s a very, very strictly part-time position. in summer i\\'ll be getting much better hours because in summer, they get much higher attendance and they need more people around.i didn\\'t have the second job in summer though. but last summer when i was at the aquarium, i was in the high 30s. so if i\\'m still at both jobs in summer, i could be looking at least a 60 hour work week, which i don\\'t know yet if i want to try further coursera classes in summer or not. yeah. seems like a lot. i need to take a break from them. yeah. yeah, so i think that\\'s everything that i have for you. if you have any questions or any other comments that come up in your mind at a later time, you can always contact me at dukecoursera gmail.com.i must thank you for your time and your feedback. we do try to improve the courses every time we offer it. it helps to understand who we\\'re teaching. it\\'s difficult from our perspective to see who our students are and what their stories are. actually, this was very helpful. thank you. and your amazon gift card - it will be emailed to you within the next week. and if you, for whatever reason don\\'t receive it, please feel free to email me at dukecoursera gmail.com ok. ok. great. thank you and have a good rest of the night. you too. thank you so much. bye.'"
